# Theme: Product Development Philosophy

## Definition

How to build products that ship fast, solve real problems, and create lasting value. Covers MVP strategy, shipping decisions, build-with-users approach, and balancing speed with foundation-first principles to enable scale without rewrites. Not: detailed project management, agile methodologies, or general productivity advice.

## Why This Matters

Founders waste months building the wrong thing or over-engineering MVPs that never launch. This helps them ship faster, validate sooner, and establish foundations that won't break at 10x growth.

## Core Angles

- **Speed vs. Quality** — context choice based on stage (Pre-PMF = speed, Post-PMF = quality, Foundation = both)
- **Build 20% that matters** — focus on what drives value, let customers guide the rest
- **Buy vs Build** — build what differentiates, buy everything else; code is liability not asset
- **Foundation-first for scale** — ship fast with bones that won't break at 10x growth
- **Build with users** — listen carefully, understand real problems, create fans not just users
- **Reduce onboarding friction** — guest/trial mode beats sign-up walls, show value immediately

## Key Messages

- Ship early, ship smaller — simplify and get to market faster
- Market dominance over perfect structure — focus on business outcomes
- Architecture not about perfection — know when to design for future vs. ship for present
- Build things that last — put care into foundation, don't make it future person's problem

## Audience

Technical Founders at pre-product to Series A; Startup CEOs stuck in planning or over-engineering MVP; Product managers learning product strategy.

## Tone

Direct, pragmatic, outcome-focused. Challenges perfectionism with frameworks and real tradeoffs.
