# Theme: Practical Engineering

## Definition

Pragmatic, get-it-done engineering that prioritizes working solutions over theoretical perfection. Covers duct-tape programming, knowing what good looks like without gold-plating, building with real users, and the mindset of shipping products that matter vs. chasing perfect code. Not: promoting sloppy code, ignoring quality, or anti-engineering practices.

## Why This Matters

Engineers get stuck in analysis paralysis and gold-plating solutions that never ship. Pragmatic engineering delivers working products, solves real problems, and maintains balance between quality standards and execution speed.

## Core Angles

- **Duct tape programmer** — fix it now, improve it later, keep systems running
- **Know what good looks like** — quality standards without perfectionism
- **Build with users** — listen carefully, understand real problems, iterate fast
- **Ugly but working > Perfect but invisible** — ship working solutions over theoretical perfection

## Key Messages

- Pragmatic engineering ships products — perfectionism kills momentum
- Know what good looks like — quality without gold-plating
- Build with users, not for users — listen and iterate
- Ugly but working wins — ship and improve based on real usage

## Audience

Engineers stuck in analysis paralysis; Junior to mid-level engineers learning pragmatic approaches; Technical founders balancing quality and speed.

## Tone

Direct, pragmatic, honest about engineering reality. Respectful of quality but focused on outcomes.
