# Angle: Know What Good Looks Like

**Theme:** Practical Engineering

## Position

Engineers need quality standards to avoid both sloppiness and perfectionism. Knowing what "good enough" looks like enables shipping quality work without gold-plating. Good code: readable, tested at boundaries, handles errors gracefully. Not: 100% coverage, perfect abstractions, zero tech debt.

## Sharp Pillars

- Quality standards prevent both chaos and perfectionism
- Good enough: readable, tested, error-handled, maintainable
- Perfect: unnecessary abstractions, premature optimization, analysis paralysis
- Experience teaches where quality matters vs where speed wins

## Signature Proof

Code with 60% test coverage on critical paths ships and scales. Code with 95% coverage on everything ships 3x slower with same production reliability. Know where quality matters; ship fast everywhere else.

## When To Use

- Code review standards
- Quality vs speed debates
- Technical debt prioritization
- Setting team quality bars
- Junior engineers learning pragmatic quality

## Tone

Pragmatic. Experience-driven. Balance-focused.
