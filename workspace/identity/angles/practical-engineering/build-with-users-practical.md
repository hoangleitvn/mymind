# Angle: Build With Users

**Theme:** Practical Engineering

## Position

Building with users means tight feedback loops, understanding real problems, and iterating based on usage. Engineers build what users ask for; great engineers understand problems behind requests and solve root causes. Fast iteration on real feedback beats perfect features built in isolation.

## Sharp Pillars

- Users tell you symptoms; engineers diagnose root problems
- Fast iteration on real feedback > perfect features in isolation
- Usage data reveals actual problems vs perceived problems
- Best products built through continuous user dialogue

## Signature Proof

Feature built in isolation: 6 weeks development → 10% adoption. Feature built with users: 2 weeks MVP → feedback → 2 weeks refinement → 60% adoption. User involvement reduces waste, increases success rate.

## When To Use

- Feature prioritization decisions
- MVP scope definition
- Product iteration strategy
- User feedback integration
- Engineers disconnected from users

## Tone

Pragmatic. User-focused. Iteration-driven.
