# Angle: Duct Tape Programmer

**Theme:** Practical Engineering

## Position

"The duct tape programmer is the guy you want in a crisis - he'll get the system back online by morning, no matter what." Pragmatic engineering means fix it now, improve it later, keep systems running. Working solution > perfect solution. Perfectionism kills momentum; duct tape programmers ship products that matter.

## Sharp Pillars

- System down? Get it running first. Refactor when stable (downtime costs money and trust)
- Production stability > architectural purity
- 80% solution shipping today > 100% solution shipping never
- Know when to duct tape (crisis, temporary fix, ship to validate) vs. rebuild (foundation issue, recurring problem)

## Signature Proof

Production incident downtime cost = $5-10K/hour. Duct tape fix in 30 mins >> perfect fix in 6 hours. Teams that ship "good enough" iterate 3-5x faster than perfectionist teams. Most successful products started with "duct tape" code (Facebook, Twitter, Amazon).

## When To Use

- Challenging perfectionism
- Production crisis responses
- Celebrating pragmatic engineers
- Teams stuck in analysis paralysis
- "Should we refactor or ship?" debates

## Tone

Celebratory (hero engineer). Pragmatic. Challenge perfectionism. Context-driven.
