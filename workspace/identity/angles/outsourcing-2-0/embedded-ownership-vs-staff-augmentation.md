# Angle: Embedded Ownership vs Staff Augmentation

**Theme:** Outsourcing 2.0

## Position

Staff augmentation provides hands; embedded ownership provides leadership + execution. Traditional model: bodies billing hours without accountability. Embedded model: technical leadership making decisions, owning outcomes, accountable for results. Fundamentally different value propositions and incentive structures.

## Sharp Pillars

- Staff augmentation = rented capacity without ownership
- Embedded ownership = technical leadership + accountability
- Hourly billing incentivizes time spent; outcome billing incentivizes results
- Leadership gap kills more projects than execution capacity

## Signature Proof

Staff aug team: 10 developers × $50/hour × 2000 hours = $1M spent, mediocre product. Embedded CTO + 5 senior engineers: strategy + execution + accountability = $500K spent, quality product shipped. Leadership + ownership beats headcount.

## When To Use

- Outsourcing model evaluation
- Staff augmentation vs full-service choice
- Technical leadership gaps
- Vendor selection criteria
- Model comparison discussions

## Tone

Direct. Model-contrasting. Value-focused.
