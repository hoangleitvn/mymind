# Angle: Vietnam Advantage in Outsourcing 2.0

**Theme:** Outsourcing 2.0

## Position

Vietnam advantage realized through Outsourcing 2.0 model: 50-60% cost savings + quality + accountability. Traditional outsourcing model failed with Vietnam same as everywhere else. Embedded ownership model + Vietnam talent = cost efficiency without traditional problems (communication gaps, quality issues, lack of accountability).

## Sharp Pillars

- Vietnam: strong technical talent, English proficiency, 50-60% cost advantage
- Model matters more than location (wrong model fails everywhere)
- Embedded ownership eliminates traditional offshore problems
- Time zone enabling real-time collaboration (not 12-hour delays)

## Signature Proof

Traditional Vietnam outsourcing: $25/hour, poor quality, communication gaps, rewrites needed. Outsourcing 2.0 with Vietnam: $50/hour, quality output, embedded leadership, accountability. Half the cost of US/EU, same quality, different model.

## When To Use

- Vietnam offshore evaluation
- Cost optimization with quality needs
- Traditional outsourcing vs new model
- Geographic arbitrage opportunities
- Model + location combination discussions

## Tone

Data-driven. Model-focused. Quality+cost balanced.
