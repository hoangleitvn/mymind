# Angle: Embedded CTO Economics

**Theme:** Cost-Effective Development

## Position

Embedded CTO model delivers senior technical leadership at fraction of full-time executive cost. Startups need CTO-level strategy, architecture, and technical decisions without $200K+ salary + equity. Fractional leadership + execution team = better economics than full-time CTO + junior team.

## Sharp Pillars

- Full-time CTO: $200K-300K + equity + benefits = $250K+ total cost
- Embedded CTO: strategic leadership + execution team at $100K-150K total
- Most startups need CTO thinking 20% of time, execution 80%
- Fractional model optimizes for actual needs vs traditional hiring

## Signature Proof

Full-time CTO $250K + 2 junior engineers $120K = $370K, limited execution velocity. Embedded CTO $60K + 3 senior engineers $180K = $240K, faster execution + better strategy. Same output, $130K annual savings, better talent leverage.

## When To Use

- Pre-seed to Series A hiring decisions
- CTO search without budget
- Technical leadership gaps
- Startup economics optimization
- Founder evaluating fractional models

## Tone

Pragmatic. Economics-focused. Model-comparison driven.
