# Angle: Vietnam Advantage Done Right

**Theme:** Cost-Effective Development

## Position

Vietnam offers 50-60% cost savings with quality and accountability when done right. Traditional outsourcing problems (poor quality, lack of ownership, communication gaps) come from wrong model, not location. Embedded ownership model + Vietnam talent = cost efficiency without compromises.

## Sharp Pillars

- 50-60% cost savings vs US/EU rates with comparable quality
- Vietnam talent pool: strong technical skills, English proficiency, work ethic
- Traditional outsourcing model fails; embedded ownership model succeeds
- Time zone overlap (US evenings = Vietnam mornings) enables real-time collaboration

## Signature Proof

US senior engineer: $150K-200K/year. Vietnam senior engineer with embedded ownership: $50K-70K/year. Same output quality, 60% cost reduction. Over 3 years: $450K savings on single senior role, $2.25M on 5-person team.

## When To Use

- Cost optimization discussions
- Hiring strategy for startups
- Offshore development evaluation
- Budget constraints with quality needs
- Scaling engineering teams efficiently

## Tone

Data-driven. Honest about model differences. ROI-focused.
