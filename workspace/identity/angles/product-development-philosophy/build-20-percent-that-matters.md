# Angle: Build 20% That Matters

**Theme:** Product Development Philosophy

## Position

Most product failures come from building too much, not too little. Build the 20% of features that drive 80% of value, then let customers tell you what the remaining 80% should be. Feature bloat kills products; focus wins markets.

## Sharp Pillars

- Every feature has cost: build time, maintenance, cognitive load on users
- Customers vote with behavior, not words — build what they use, not what they say
- Do one thing exceptionally well > do ten things poorly
- "Avoid side quests" — every distraction delays core value delivery

## Signature Proof

Pareto principle validated across 50+ INNOMIZE projects: 80% of value from 20% of features. Most products have 60-80% of features rarely/never used. Focused products ship 3-5x faster than comprehensive ones.

## When To Use

- MVP scope discussions
- Feature prioritization debates
- Founders building 30-feature roadmap based on assumptions
- Product teams adding "nice to have" features
- Responding to every customer feature request

## Tone

Direct. Challenging (cut ruthlessly). Outcome-focused. Customer behavior-driven.
