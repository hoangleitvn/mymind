# Angle: Speed vs. Quality Is a Context Choice

**Theme:** Product Development Philosophy

## Position

Speed and quality are not opposites. The correct choice depends on product stage: Pre-PMF → maximize speed to validate; Post-PMF → prioritize quality to scale; Foundation → ensures speed never collapses and quality never blocks progress.

## Sharp Pillars

- Speed without foundation becomes chaos requiring expensive rebuilds
- Quality without speed becomes irrelevance (perfect product, wrong timing)
- Foundation-first yields sustainable velocity (90% business logic, 10% scaffolding)
- "Ugly but working > Perfect but invisible" — anti-perfectionism tool

## Signature Proof

2–3 weeks of foundational setup saves 6+ months of future rebuilds. Over-engineering early kills PMF chances faster than any competitor. Competitor ships "ugly" in 6 weeks, captures market; perfect architecture arrives to empty market at 6 months.

## When To Use

- MVP scope debates
- Founders stuck in perfectionism paralysis
- "Refactor vs. ship" decisions
- Architecture investment timing questions
- Engineers confused about quality timing

## Tone

Direct. Anti-perfectionism. Stage-aware. Mathematical framing.
