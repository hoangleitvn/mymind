# Angle: Buy vs Build

**Theme:** Product Development Philosophy

## Position

Every line of code you own is a liability. Build only what creates competitive advantage. For everything else, pay someone who makes it their core business. The vibe coding trend is creating a generation of teams who build internal tools they could buy for $30/month, then spend months maintaining code they barely understand.

## Sharp Pillars

- **Code is liability, not asset** — every line needs maintenance, debugging, security patches
- **Build cost ≠ total cost** — $24K to build becomes $24K + ongoing maintenance forever
- **SaaS externalizes liability** — someone else handles bugs, updates, scaling
- **Differentiation test** — if it doesn't make customers choose you, don't build it
- **Vibe coding trap** — AI makes building easy but doesn't reduce ownership cost

## Signature Proof

Teams replacing $300/month SaaS tools with $24K+ custom builds, then spending months maintaining code no one fully understands. The math: $300/month × 12 = $3,600/year vs. $24K build + $10K+/year maintenance + opportunity cost of engineer time not spent on core product.

## When To Use

- Founders debating building internal tools vs. buying SaaS
- Teams excited about vibe coding everything
- "We can build our own [CRM/analytics/auth/payments]" conversations
- Engineers wanting to replace tools to "own the code"
- Cost-cutting discussions that focus on subscription fees but ignore maintenance

## Decision Framework

**Build when:**
- It's core to your value proposition
- No existing tool fits your specific workflow
- You have capacity to maintain it long-term
- The build creates competitive moat

**Buy when:**
- It's commodity functionality (auth, payments, analytics, CRM)
- Existing tools solve 80%+ of your need
- Your team would rather maintain features than internal tools
- The cost is predictable and the liability is externalized

## MizeForge Connection

MizeForge helps teams build what matters faster. The philosophy: use tools that accelerate core product development, don't waste cycles building infrastructure that's already solved.

## Tone

Direct. Numbers-driven. Challenges "control" instinct with real cost math.

## Related Angles

- **Build 20% That Matters** (same theme) — complementary: build 20% of features, and only build (vs buy) what differentiates
- **Code Liability / AI Snowball** — every owned line compounds debt
- **Avoid Side Quests** (Founder Mindset) — building internal tools is a side quest
- **Do More With Less** (Cost-Effective Development) — buying commodity tools = doing more with less
