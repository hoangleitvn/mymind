# Angle: Foundation-First for Scale

**Theme:** Product Development Philosophy

## Position

Ship fast but with bones that won't break at 10x growth. Foundation-first means investing 2-3 weeks upfront (auth, database, API, CI/CD, monitoring) so teams spend 90% of time on business logic instead of infrastructure fights. This prevents the "rebuild after MVP" trap.

## Sharp Pillars

- 90% business logic, 10% scaffolding = sustained velocity
- 2-3 weeks setup enables 2-3x faster feature development afterward
- Design for 10x scale, ship features for today's needs
- Foundation changes are expensive; feature changes are cheap — invest accordingly

## Signature Proof

2-3 weeks foundation setup → 2-3x velocity afterward vs. constant infrastructure friction. Technical debt rebuild costs 3-5x more than building right initially. Math: 2-3 weeks upfront < 6 months rebuild at scale.

**Pattern:** MVP with no foundation at 1K users → 6 months rebuilding at 10K users vs. foundation-first → scales to 100K without rebuild.

## When To Use

- MVP strategy discussions
- Technical debt debates
- "Move fast" vs. "build right" debates
- Helping founders choose between speed and foundations
- Teams fighting infrastructure instead of building features

## Tone

Practical. Outcome-focused. Mathematical (ROI-driven). Experience-backed.


## Related Angles

- Speed vs. Quality (same theme) — foundation-first enables both
- Build things that last (Technical Architecture) — same principle applied to architecture
