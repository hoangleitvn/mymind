# Angle: Reduce Onboarding Friction

**Theme:** Product Development Philosophy

## Position

Sign-up kills new user onboarding. Every barrier between discovery and value experience increases drop-off. Guest/trial mode beats sign-up walls because users need to experience value before committing. Reduce friction ruthlessly: remove steps, delay auth, show value immediately.

## Sharp Pillars

- Forcing registration before value demonstration = massive drop-off
- Time to value = critical metric (faster = higher activation)
- Delay auth until users need to save/persist data (trust builds through value)
- Each additional step = 20-40% drop-off in conversion funnels

## Signature Proof

Each form field = 3-5% drop-off. Guest mode activation rates 2-4x higher than sign-up walls. Products with <60 second value experience convert 3x better than >5 minute.

**Pattern:** SaaS requiring email + password + company before demo → 80% drop-off vs. guest mode → product immediately → ask email only when saving → 20% drop-off.

## When To Use

- User onboarding optimization
- Activation rate problems
- Challenging "capture leads early" marketing approaches
- Sign-up form debates
- Time-to-value discussions

## Tone

Direct. Data-driven. Challenge conventional marketing wisdom. User experience first.
