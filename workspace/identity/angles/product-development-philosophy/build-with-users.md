# Angle: Build with Users

**Theme:** Product Development Philosophy

## Position

Listen carefully to users and understand their real problems, not what they say they want. Building "with" users means tight feedback loops, observing behavior over surveys, and creating fans who use, love, and defend the product. Behavior trumps words; fans drive growth.

## Sharp Pillars

- Users describe symptoms, not root causes — your job is diagnosis
- Watch what users do, not just what they say (usage > surveys)
- Create fans, not just users — fans drive viral growth
- Tight feedback loops: weekly iterations beat quarterly releases

## Signature Proof

Products built with user feedback succeed 3x more than isolation builds (INNOMIZE experience across 50+ projects). Feature usage analytics predict success better than feature request surveys.

**Pattern:** Users request feature A in survey → build A → nobody uses it. Watch behavior → users struggle with B → build B → high adoption.

## When To Use

- Product validation discussions
- Customer development questions
- Founders building in isolation
- Feature request prioritization
- Onboarding optimization (watch users, find friction)

## Tone

Empathetic. User-focused. Behavior-driven. Challenge "build and they will come" assumptions.

- Reduce onboarding friction (same theme) — watch users to find friction points
