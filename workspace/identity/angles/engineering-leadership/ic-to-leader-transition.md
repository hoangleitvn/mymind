# Angle: IC to Leader Transition

**Theme:** Engineering Leadership

## Position

Moving from individual contributor to leader requires fundamentally different skills. Success shifts from personal output to team enablement. Most new leaders fail by continuing to code instead of learning to lead — they become bottlenecks rather than multipliers.

## Sharp Pillars

- Leadership is learned, not inherited from technical skill
- Your value shifts from code shipped to team enabled
- Delegation beats doing; coaching beats fixing
- Best ICs often struggle most as new leaders (optimization vs. leadership)

## Signature Proof

IC outputs 1x. Leader enabling 5 engineers outputs 5x. Leader still coding full-time + managing = 0.5x output + 0.2x leadership = net negative. Transition requires letting go of personal IC work to unlock team multiplication.

## When To Use

- Engineers promoted to leadership roles
- New managers struggling with delegation
- Leaders still coding full-time
- IC considering management track
- Performance issues from leader bottlenecks

## Tone

Direct. Empathetic. Reality-focused.
