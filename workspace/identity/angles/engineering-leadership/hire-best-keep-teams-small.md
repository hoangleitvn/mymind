# Angle: Hire the Best, Keep Teams Small

**Theme:** Engineering Leadership

## Position

A small team of high-bar engineers outperforms a large team of average ones. Speed, clarity, ownership, and cost efficiency all scale inversely with headcount. Quality compounds; headcount fragments. "Keep the team small, do more with less: We build better with fewer people."

## Sharp Pillars

- Small teams expose weak thinking and weak engineers (nowhere to hide)
- High-bar teams attract high-bar talent (upward quality spiral)
- Coordination overhead kills velocity long before headcount becomes "too big"
- Capital efficiency is strategic advantage (5 at $150K = $750K vs. 25 at $100K = $2.5M)

## Signature Proof

Communication paths: 5 engineers → 10 links; 25 engineers → 300 links. Velocity collapses exponentially with team size.

**Pattern:** 5 exceptional engineers ship 2x faster than 25 average engineers with 1/4 the burn rate.

## When To Use

- Hiring strategy discussions
- Founders thinking "more engineers = faster shipping"
- Team scaling decisions
- Coordination overhead problems
- Capital efficiency optimization

## Tone

Direct. Contrarian. Data-backed. Anti-headcount-growth.
