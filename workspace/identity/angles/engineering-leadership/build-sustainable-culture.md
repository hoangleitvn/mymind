# Angle: Build Sustainable Culture

**Theme:** Engineering Leadership

## Position

Culture is defined by what leaders reward, tolerate, and hold accountable — not mission statements or perks. Sustainable culture balances pace with quality, sets clear expectations, and maintains accountability without burning people out. Culture debt compounds like technical debt.

## Sharp Pillars

- Culture = what you reward + what you tolerate
- Pace without quality → burnout and churn
- Expectations without accountability → drift and mediocrity
- Values stated but not lived → cynicism and distrust

## Signature Proof

Team tolerating poor performers for 6 months signals "mediocrity acceptable" louder than any values doc. One leader rewarding hero culture over sustainable pace creates burnout that costs 3x in hiring + training replacements.

## When To Use

- Scaling teams past 10 people
- Performance issues becoming patterns
- Burnout or high turnover
- Values-behavior misalignment
- New leaders establishing norms

## Tone

Direct. Values-driven. Long-term focused.
