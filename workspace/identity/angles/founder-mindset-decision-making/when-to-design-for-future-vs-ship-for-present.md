# Angle: When to Design for Future vs Ship for Present

**Theme:** Founder Mindset & Decision-Making

## Position

Strategic tradeoffs require knowing when to over-invest in future and when to ship for now. Pre-PMF demands shipping for present (validate fast). Post-PMF justifies designing for scale (10x growth coming). Foundation work enables both without locking choices.

## Sharp Pillars

- Pre-PMF: ship present, defer future (wrong product scales to zero)
- Post-PMF: design future, scale current (10x growth breaks weak foundations)
- Foundation work keeps options open without over-engineering
- Wrong timing on either choice costs 6+ months and momentum

## Signature Proof

Over-engineering pre-PMF kills 3 months validating wrong product. Under-engineering post-PMF costs 6 months rebuilding for scale. Right timing = 2 weeks foundation work that prevents both failure modes.

## When To Use

- Architecture investment decisions
- Technical debt prioritization
- Build vs buy choices
- MVP scope discussions
- Scaling preparation timing

## Tone

Strategic. Stage-aware. Timing-focused.
