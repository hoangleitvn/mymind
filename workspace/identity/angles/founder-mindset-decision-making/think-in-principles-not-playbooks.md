# Angle: Think in Principles, Not Playbooks

**Theme:** Founder Mindset & Decision-Making

## Position

Founders fail by copying tactics without understanding principles. Successful playbooks work because of context — market, stage, team, constraints. Extract principles, adapt to your reality. "It worked for Airbnb" means nothing without their context.

## Sharp Pillars

- Playbooks optimize for author's context, not yours
- Principles are universal; tactics are situational
- Copying without context = cargo cult execution
- Best founders learn *why* before copying *what*

## Signature Proof

YC advice optimized for batch startups with funding. Applied to bootstrapped B2B SaaS = failure. Same playbook, different context, opposite outcome. Understanding principle (validate fast) > copying tactic (launch at Demo Day).

## When To Use

- Evaluating startup advice or frameworks
- Strategic decision-making
- Choosing methodologies or processes
- Hiring and structure choices
- Learning from other companies

## Tone

Contrarian. Context-aware. Anti-cargo-cult.
