# Who I Am

## Professional Identity

**Role:** Engineering Tech Leader & Founder
- CXO focusing on founder, engineering, and product development
- Operator-founder who embeds as technical owner

**Company:** INNOMIZE
- Tech/Consultant company (<50 engineers)
- Vision: Build better solutions for better lives

**Background:**
- 15+ years building engineering teams and software products (startups and enterprise)
- Built and delivered 50+ projects: websites, SaaS platforms, enterprise solutions, custom applications
- Experience in system integration (A2A, B2B)
- Strong expertise in cloud computing (AWS, Azure)
- Designed and scaled products with monolith/modular architecture and microservices

**Expertise:**
- Engineering leadership and team scaling
- Product development (MVP → scale)
- Technical architecture and system design
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure)
- System integration and distributed systems
- Embedded CTO/VP Engineering model
- Cost-effective development with offshore teams

## Positioning

I help founders and companies build → scale teams and MVPs, acting as their embedded engineering leader (CTO or VP of Engineering). With INNOMIZE, we deliver accountability-driven development that gets founders from zero to live users with speed, compliance, and focus - not hourly excuses.

**Who I serve:**
- Technical Founders and Startup CEOs (pre-product → Series A)
- Early-stage companies (0-25 engineers or no tech team yet)
- Established companies needing team augmentation and capability partnerships
- Non-technical co-founders who need engineering leadership

**What I solve:**
- Can't hire/afford full-time CTO or VP Engineering
- Stuck between vision and execution (idea but no technical leadership)
- Stuck in planning phase - need help getting unstuck and building
- Need to move fast but lack engineering foundation
- "Work about work" overhead slowing teams down
- Quality vs. speed tradeoffs
- High IT costs - need cost-effective solution (50-60% savings vs. US/EU rates)

## Credibility Markers

**Achievements:**
- Founded INNOMIZE in 2018 with accountability-first model
- Built and scaled engineering team to 40+ engineers (including partner network)
- Delivered 50+ successful projects from zero to live users
- Implemented embedded CTO model with proven outcomes
- Achieved 50-60% cost savings for clients (Vietnam-based team, $20-30/hour rates)
- Designed foundation-first approach: 90% business logic, 10% scaffolding

**Experience:**
- 15+ years in engineering leadership and team building
- Expertise across web, SaaS, enterprise, and custom solutions
- System integration (A2A, B2B) at scale
- Cloud architecture design and scaling (AWS, Azure)
- Monolith → microservices evolution at multiple companies

**Unique Perspective:**
- Operator-founder who combines business + technology bridge
- Not just tech focus - people + tools matter equally
- "Work about work" insight → ownership-first approach
- Embedded ownership model, not traditional staff augmentation
- Foundation-first: enable teams to focus on business logic, not scaffolding

## Current Focus

Currently helping founders and companies launch real products fast, acting as technical owner (CTO or VP Engineering) when needed, and embedding foundations from day one so teams can focus on business outcomes, not infrastructure.

**Active projects:**
- Building INNOMIZE's embedded CTO model at scale
- Developing Mize Studio (product development arm)
- Helping founders go from zero to live users with speed + compliance

**Learning:**
- Modern engineering practices and AI-assisted development
- Product development optimization (build 20% that matters)
- Outsourcing 2.0 model (accountability over hours)
- Reducing user onboarding friction (guest/trial mode > sign-up walls)
