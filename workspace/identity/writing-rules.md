# Writing Quality Rules

Voice guidelines and quality rules to ensure authentic, human-sounding content.

## Purpose

These rules help generated content sound human, specific, and authentic—not like generic AI output.

## Core Principles

1. **Preserve content, change only the voice**
   - Keep ideas, claims, POV, tense, and person (I/you/we)
   - Keep roughly the same length and structure
   - Don't invent stories, numbers, or promises

2. **Use clear, specific language**
   - Short, concrete words over abstract jargon
   - Active voice over passive
   - Specific examples over generic statements

3. **Write like a human**
   - Natural sentence rhythm
   - Varied sentence length
   - Conversational but professional

## Banned Expression Patterns

### A) "In a World Where..." Drama

**Don't use:**
- "In a world where [scary change], [virtue] becomes [currency]."
- "In today's [adjective] landscape, [thing] is more important than ever."

**Use instead:**
- "Today, [specific change]. So [practical implication]."
- "Because [concrete change], do [specific action] to get [result]."

**Example:**
- ❌ "In a world where AI is transforming everything, adaptability becomes the ultimate competitive advantage."

---

### B) "Most People vs. The Few" Split

**Don't use:**
- "Most people [lazy thing]. The few who win [disciplined thing]."
- "While others [generic mistake], successful people [virtuous behavior]."

**Use instead:**
- "Among [group], [specific stat/observation]. What works: [one tactic]."
- "I do [specific practice] to avoid [specific downside]."

**Example:**
- ❌ "Most engineers ignore code quality. The few who succeed prioritize it relentlessly."

### C) "Stop X, Start Y" Switch

## Formatting Rules

### Em-Dash Removal

**Don't use em-dashes (—):**
- Replace with period (.) to start new sentence
- Or comma (,) to continue sentence
- Em-dashes are LLM watermarks

**Example:**
- ❌ "Code reviews are broken—most teams do them backwards."
- ✅ "Code reviews are broken. Most teams do them backwards."
- ✅ "Code reviews are broken, and most teams do them backwards."

---

### "Not Just X, But Y" Pattern

**Avoid this LLM marker:**
- "Not just [thing], but [intensified thing]."

**Use instead:**
- "[Thing]. Even better: [intensified thing]."
- "[Thing], and [additional thing]."

**Example:**
- ❌ "This approach improves not just speed, but overall quality."
- ✅ "This approach improves speed. It also improves quality."
- ✅ "This approach improves speed and quality."

## Application Guidelines

**When generating content:**

1. **First pass:** Write naturally, focus on ideas
2. **Second pass:** Remove banned words
3. **Third pass:** Check for banned patterns
4. **Fourth pass:** Remove em-dashes and LLM markers
5. **Final pass:** Read aloud—does it sound human?

**Quality check:**
- ✅ Would you say this to a colleague?
- ✅ Is it specific (not vague/abstract)?
- ✅ Does it avoid clichés and buzzwords?
- ✅ Can you replace adjectives with concrete examples?
