## Comment Angles to Use

Based on your themes:

| If you see posts about... | Your angle |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Hiring first engineers | Embedded CTO model as alternative to full-time hire |
| MVP building struggles | Foundation-first: 90% business logic, 10% scaffolding |
| Engineering costs | 50-60% savings with accountability model, not hourly excuses |
| Team scaling challenges | "Work about work" insight - ownership > process |
| Technical debt | Ship fast without sacrificing quality - it's not either/or |
| Outsourcing failures | Outsourcing 2.0 - embedded ownership, not staff aug |
