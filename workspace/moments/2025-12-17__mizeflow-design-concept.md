# Mizeflow Design Concept Completed

## What Was Created

Comprehensive design document for Mizeflow capturing:

### Design Philosophy (5 Principles)
1. **Zero UI** - No traditional menus, content floats in space
2. **Voice + Gesture First** - Speak → AI structures → Human approves
3. **AI as Collaborator** - Partner, not tool; suggests with reasoning
4. **Spatial Computing Ready** - Constellation canvas, pan/zoom, depth
5. **Ambient Intelligence** - Context-aware suggestions without asking

### Visual System
- Void backgrounds (#050508 - #0d0d1a)
- Bioluminescent accents (cyan, violet, aurora)
- Glassmorphism with backdrop blur
- Organic, breathing animations

### Core Features
1. **Constellation View** - Spatial canvas with floating nodes
2. **Flow View** - Kanban-style pipeline (Moment → Forming → Ready → Published)
3. **Timeline View** - Chronological history
4. **Writing Studio** - Voice/edit canvas + AI partner panel
5. **Node Detail** - Device previews, platform tabs, actions

### User Flows Documented
- Capture → Publish (voice path)
- Studio Writing (edit path)
- Repurpose existing content

### Technical Stack
- Next.js 16 + React 19
- Zustand with persistence
- Framer Motion + @use-gesture
- Web Speech API
- Claude Code CLI integration (planned)

## The Vision

```
2020: Type → Edit → Publish
2025: Type → AI Suggests → Edit → Publish
2030: Speak → AI Structures → Review → Publish
```

**Mizeflow is designed to scale from screen to spatial to neural.**
