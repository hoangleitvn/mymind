# AI is Transforming How I Choose Tools

## Raw Capture
I cancelled Lovable ($25/mo.) yesterday - plan to move to Google. And today I cancel Lucidchart ($11/mo.) since I might build Diagram as code instead of using GUI - AI transform the way I work.

## Context
- Two tool cancellations in two days
- Monthly savings: $36/mo ($432/year)
- Shift from GUI-based tools to AI-native or code-based alternatives

## Key Takeaways
- AI is making traditional GUI tools less necessary
- "Diagram as code" replaces visual editors - code is now the source of truth
- The subscription model is being disrupted by AI capabilities
- Moving from specialized paid tools to AI-augmented alternatives

## Content Potential
- Platform: LinkedIn
- Format: Short insight post
- Angle: "AI is quietly killing my subscriptions" - personal case study of how AI changes tool choices
- Hook: The $36/month I'm not spending anymore

## Related Themes
- Tool-switching costs (but now AI reduces switching friction)
- Build vs buy decisions shifting
- AI-native workflows

## Follow-up
- Track how Diagram as code workflow works in practice
- Document the Google alternative for Lovable
- Calculate total subscription reduction over 2024-2025
