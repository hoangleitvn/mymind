# Need Better Time Management - Too Much Mode Switching

## Raw Capture

I am not good and need to manage my time better. It seems I am randomly picking stuff between many modes/domains. I even defined working routines but not strictly followed.

## The Problem

- Jumping between different modes/domains randomly
- Have defined routines but not following them
- Lack of discipline in sticking to the plan
- Context switching costs adding up

## Context

- Multiple domains: INNOMIZE (company), Mize Studio (products), Builds That Last (content), client work
- Already created routines/structure but execution is inconsistent
- Self-awareness is there - recognizing the problem is step one

## Why This Matters

- Context switching kills deep work
- Random task selection = reactive, not proactive
- Routines only work when followed
- Leader behavior sets team culture

## Potential Solutions to Explore

1. **Time blocking** - Dedicate specific hours to specific domains
2. **Theme days** - Monday = content, Tuesday = client, etc.
3. **Morning routine lock** - Protect first 2-3 hours for deep work
4. **Accountability** - Share schedule with someone who checks in
5. **Reduce domains** - Say no to some things
6. **Batch similar tasks** - Group by mode, not by urgency
7. **Weekly review** - Check if routine was followed, adjust

## Questions to Answer

- What triggers the random switching? (Notifications? Boredom? Urgency?)
- Which domains actually need daily attention vs. weekly?
- What's the cost of current behavior? (Quantify if possible)
- What's the minimum viable routine that you'd actually follow?

## Content Potential

- **Platform**: LinkedIn, Newsletter
- **Format**: Personal reflection post, "What I'm learning" style
- **Angle**: Honest take on founder time management struggles
- **Why it resonates**: Many founders/leaders face the same issue

## Follow-up

- [ ] Review existing routine definition
- [ ] Identify top 3 mode-switching triggers
- [ ] Design simpler routine (start small)
- [ ] Set up accountability mechanism
- [ ] Revisit in 1 week
