## Idea

Question for the community about AI workflow: architecture mode vs coding mode

## Draft

I've been separating my AI sessions into two modes:

**Architecture Mode** - Design decisions, system structure, trade-offs
**Coding Mode** - Implementation, code quality, tests

Different focus, different context, different outputs.

| Aspect     | Architecture Mode                  | Coding Mode                      |
|------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Focus      | Design decisions, system structure | Implementation, code quality     |
| Input      | Requirements, constraints          | Architecture docs, specs         |
| Output     | Design docs, ADRs, diagrams        | Code, tests, PRs                 |
| Context    | Patterns, principles, trade-offs   | Standards, best practices, rules |
| Dependency | Can stand alone                    | Often needs architecture input   |

Curious how others work with AI:
- Do you keep these modes separate (one per session)?
- Or do you mix architecture and coding in the same conversation?
- Does switching modes mid-session confuse the AI or break context?

What's working for you?

## Why This Matters

- Architecture needs broad thinking, trade-off analysis
- Coding needs precision, standards, best practices
- Mixing them might dilute both
- But separating them adds overhead

## Notes

- Could become LinkedIn post or poll
- Ties to our "foundation-first" approach
- Real question I'm exploring in my own workflow
