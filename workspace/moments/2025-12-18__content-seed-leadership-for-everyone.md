# Leadership Skills Are for Everyone, Not Just Leaders

## Core Insight

Leadership skill isn't for leader roles - it is for everyone. You don't need a title to demonstrate leadership behaviors.

## Engineering 2.0 - Level Framework

| Level | Delivers |
|-------|----------|
| Junior | A task |
| Middle | A project |
| Senior/Lead | A standard |
| Management | A team |

## Leadership Behaviors - With Title

- Inspires and motivates team members
- Sets clear goals and expectations
- Provides guidance and support
- Facilitates effective communication
- Resolves conflicts, promotes collaboration
- Leads by example with integrity and accountability
- Encourages professional growth of team members

## Leadership Behaviors - Without Title

- Demonstrates initiative, takes charge when needed
- Exhibits influence by motivating and supporting colleagues
- Communicates effectively and clearly
- Contributes to team decisions and problem-solving
- Shows responsibility and accountability in work
- Acts as role model, adhering to values and standards
- Provides informal mentorship or guidance to peers

## Governance vs Management Framework

| Aspect | Governance | Management |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Focus | Strategic: "Are we doing the right things?" | Tactical: "Are we doing things right?" |
| Scope | Portfolio/org-wide | Project/product specific |
| Who | Executives, Steering Committees, PMO | Project Managers, Tech Leads, Product Owners |
| Output | Policies, standards, compliance, funding | Deliverables, releases, sprint goals |
| Question | What to do | How to do it |

**Key distinction:**
- Governance = doing the right projects
- Management = doing the projects right

## NEW Content Angles (Not Yet Published)

### 1. Leadership Without a Title (Primary Opportunity)
The published content focuses on levels and what you deliver. This moment adds a new angle: **leadership behaviors available to everyone regardless of role**.

**Post idea:** "You don't need a title to lead"
- Core insight: Leadership skills aren't for leader roles - they're for everyone
- Compare: Leadership with title vs without title
- Show: Specific behaviors ICs can demonstrate today
- Tie back to: Your existing framework (this is the "how" that enables level transitions)

### 2. Governance vs Management
Completely new framework not in published content.

**Post idea:** "Strategic vs Operational: Which game are you playing?"
- Governance = "Are we doing the right things?"
- Management = "Are we doing things right?"
- Apply to: Individual career decisions, not just org structure

### 3. 1-on-1 Question Frameworks
Practical tool not covered in existing content.

**Post idea:** "The questions that reveal where you actually are"
- Different stakeholders ask different questions
- CEO questions (strategic), EM questions (execution), HR questions (growth)
- Self-assessment: Which questions resonate with you?

### 4. The "Let's Just Do It" Trap
Links to reactive-vs-deliberate insight.

**Post idea:** "Why 'just do it' fails in career growth"
- Execution bias vs deliberate progression
- Connects to: Your framework requires thinking shifts, not just doing more

## Connection to Other Moments

- Links to `reactive-vs-deliberate-thinking` - Leadership requires deliberate thinking, asking questions before acting
- Links to `tool-switching-costs` - Career transitions (A to B) also need context and planning
- **Extends existing published work** - Builds on Engineering 2.0 framework with new angles

## Raw Notes

"Let do it / Just do it" - Execution bias vs deliberate planning tension
