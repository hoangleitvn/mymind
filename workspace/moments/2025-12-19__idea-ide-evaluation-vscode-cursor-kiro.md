# Evaluate AI-Native IDEs: VSCode vs Cursor vs Kiro

## Raw Capture
TODO: evaluation IDE like VSCode vs Cursor vs Kiro (AWS), etc.

## Why This Matters
- AI is transforming the IDE landscape
- Moving from "editor with AI plugin" to "AI-native editor"
- Tool choice impacts daily productivity significantly
- Kiro (AWS) is new entrant - worth evaluating

## Candidates to Evaluate

| IDE | Type | AI Integration |
|-----|------|----------------|
| VSCode | Traditional + Extensions | Copilot, Continue, etc. |
| Cursor | AI-Native (VSCode fork) | Built-in Claude/GPT |
| Kiro | AI-Native (AWS) | Amazon Q integration? |
| Windsurf | AI-Native | Codeium |
| Zed | Performance-focused | AI features growing |

## Evaluation Criteria
- AI capabilities (autocomplete, chat, agents)
- Performance & responsiveness
- Extension ecosystem
- Cost (subscription model)
- Privacy & data handling
- Workflow integration (git, terminal, debugging)

## Content Potential
- Platform: LinkedIn, Substack
- Format: Comparison article or series
- Angle: "I tested 5 AI IDEs so you don't have to"
- Ties to: AI transforms how I work (subscription cancellations moment)

## Follow-up
- [ ] Install and test Kiro
- [ ] Define evaluation criteria with weights
- [ ] Document 1-week trial with each
- [ ] Compare against Claude Code CLI workflow
