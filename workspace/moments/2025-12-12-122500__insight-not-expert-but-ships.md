# Not an Expert in Anything, But I Ship

## Raw Capture

I might not be a good architect, but I've built many systems.
I might not be good as a cloud engineer, but most systems I built run on cloud.
I might not be good at frontend/React.js...
Then Angular, Node.js, backend, DevOps, SecOps, GitOps, etc.
I'm not good at LeetCode, but I use AI to solve it.

This moment shows I'm talking to myself → maybe turn into a post?

## The Insight

There's a pattern here: **not being "expert-level" in any single thing, but still shipping real systems that work.**

This is the generalist builder mindset:
- Know enough to be dangerous
- Know enough to hire/lead specialists
- Know enough to ship
- Use tools (including AI) to fill gaps

## Why This Resonates

- Imposter syndrome is real for builders
- The industry celebrates specialists, but generalists ship products
- "Good enough to ship" > "Perfect but never done"
- AI changes what "expertise" means

## The Tension

| What society values | What actually ships |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Deep expertise | Broad competence |
| LeetCode scores | Problem-solving ability |
| Certifications | Real systems running |
| Specialist title | Generalist execution |

## Content Potential

**This is content-ready.** High resonance potential.

- **Platform**: LinkedIn (primary), Newsletter
- **Format**: Personal reflection, list format
- **Hook angle**: Contrarian / Vulnerability
- **Tone**: Honest, slightly self-deprecating, confident conclusion

### Draft Hook Ideas

1. "I'm not an expert at anything. Here's what I've built anyway."
2. "I can't pass a LeetCode interview. I've shipped 50+ systems."
3. "Not a good architect. Not a good cloud engineer. Not a good frontend dev. Still shipping."

### Structure Idea

```
Hook: List of things I'm "not good at"
Turn: But here's what I've actually done
Insight: The industry overvalues specialists, undervalues shippers
Close: You don't need to be the best. You need to ship.
```
