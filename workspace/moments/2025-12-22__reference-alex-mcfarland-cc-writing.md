# Alex McFarland: Claude Code for Writing Masterclass

## Raw Capture

This guide is doing something with Claude Code for writing. Check and see how it aligns with my approach (Mizemind).

## Source Summary

**Author:** Alex McFarland
**Title:** Claude Code for Writing [Masterclass]
**Claim:** $100K+ annual writing operation powered by Claude Code

## His Framework: Two-Layer System

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Production Layer** | Where content gets created (Claude Code, skills, context profiles) |
| **Knowledge Layer** | Where thinking and reference materials live (drafts, notes, published work) |

## Three Essential Context Profiles

1. **Voice DNA** — Communication style, tone, language preferences
2. **ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)** — Target audience, problems, language
3. **Business Profile** — Offerings, positioning, value proposition

## Key Components

- **Skills**: Reusable instruction packages for specific content types ("Write once. Use forever.")
- **System Architecture**: Master CLAUDE.md file containing system instructions

## Alignment with Mizemind

| Alex McFarland | Mizemind Equivalent |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Voice DNA | `foundation/identity/voice.md` |
| ICP | `foundation/identity/audience.md` |
| Business Profile | `foundation/identity/whoami.md` |
| Skills | `plugins/*/skills/` |
| CLAUDE.md | `CLAUDE.md` + context-engine |
| Production Layer | Skills + execution |
| Knowledge Layer | `workspace/` (moments, library, drafts) |

## Key Insight

**Strong validation of Mizemind architecture.**

Both systems share:
- Context-first approach (identity, voice, audience)
- Skill-based reusable patterns
- Separation of knowledge and production
- CLAUDE.md as central orchestrator

## Differences / Opportunities

| His Approach | Mizemind |
|--------------|-----------|
| Manual setup | Plugin-based, shareable |
| Three profiles | Full identity-kit with personas, themes, angles |
| Cursor-focused | Claude Code native |
| Writing-only | Multi-domain (content, design, code) |

## Content Potential

**Angles:**
- "I built something similar. Here's what I learned."
- "The context-first approach to AI writing"
- "Why skills beat prompts for content creation"
- Compare/contrast article on Substack

**Collaboration:**
- Could reach out to Alex McFarland
- Potential cross-promotion or interview

  - Sign #6: "You Understand the Architecture" — his two-layer system = architecture understanding
  - His approach proves the post's thesis: structure > prompts
