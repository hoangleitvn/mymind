# You're Not Bad. Your Approach Is Wrong.

## Raw Capture

I am thinking: You are not worse than you think, but what you are doing is wrong. Like they can do anything, they can plan, then build and learn. But people do it differently. Is that right?

## The Insight

The problem isn't capability. The problem is approach.

People aren't bad at their jobs. They're doing the job wrong.

**The pattern:**
- They CAN plan. But they don't.
- They CAN learn. But they skip it.
- They CAN build well. But they rush.

**The fix isn't:**
- "Work harder"
- "Be smarter"
- "Get better"

**The fix is:**
- "Change your approach"
- "Do things in the right order"
- "Follow a process that works"

## Why This Matters

This reframes feedback from criticism to coaching.

| Criticism | Coaching |
|-----------|----------|
| "You're not good at this" | "Your approach isn't working" |
| "You need to improve" | "Let's try a different method" |
| "This is wrong" | "The process is wrong" |

**Criticism attacks the person.**
**Coaching fixes the approach.**

## The Connection to Earlier Moments

This ties together several observations:

1. **Vibe coding** - Not bad developers. Wrong approach (prompting without understanding).

2. **No planning** - Not bad workers. Wrong approach (reacting instead of planning).

3. **Premature optimization** - Not bad engineers. Wrong approach (polishing before building).

4. **Not expert but ships** - Not needing to be the best. Right approach (know enough, ship).

**Common thread:** Capability exists. Approach is the variable.

## The Reframe

Instead of: "Why can't you do this?"
Ask: "What approach are you using?"

Instead of: "You need to be better"
Say: "Let's try a different approach"

Instead of: "This person is bad"
Think: "This approach isn't working for them"

## Content Potential

**High resonance. Empowering message.**

**Hook options:**
- "You're not worse than you think. Your approach is wrong."
- "The problem isn't capability. The problem is method."
- "Stop trying to be better. Start doing things differently."

**Structure:**
- Hook: The reframe
- Examples: Planning, vibe coding, premature optimization
- Insight: Same capability, different approach, different results
- CTA: What approach are you using?

## Why This Is True

Most people have the raw capability to do their jobs well.

What separates high performers:
- Not intelligence
- Not talent
- Not working harder

But:
- Right approach
- Right order of operations
- Right process

You can teach approach. You can't easily teach capability.

This is why coaching works. This is why frameworks help. This is why "how" matters more than "who."
