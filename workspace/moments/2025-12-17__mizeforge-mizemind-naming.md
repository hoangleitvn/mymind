# Product Naming Decision: MizeForge vs Mizemind

## The Question
Deciding between using **MizeForge** or **Mizemind** as the core platform name.

## Context
- **MizeForge** = the brain, the content creation engine
- **Mizeflow** = visualization layer, spatial canvas for content constellation

## Considerations
- MizeForge implies crafting, building, forging ideas into content
- Mizemind suggests thinking, cognition, the mental aspects of content creation
- The "Mize" prefix creates a product family: Mizeforge, Mizeflow, Mizemind

## Architecture View
```
Mizemind (?)          - Strategic thinking layer
    └── MizeForge     - Content creation brain
        └── Mizeflow  - Visual content pipeline
```

## Open Questions
- Does "forge" convey the crafting aspect better?
- Does "mind" suggest AI/intelligence partnership better?
- Could both coexist with different roles?
