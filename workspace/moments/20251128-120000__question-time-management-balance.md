# I wish I had more time

## Raw Capture

I wish I have more time (e.g. 48h more), my wife is complaining about me. How can I manage my time better?

## Context

- Feeling squeezed between work demands and family time
- Wife expressing frustration — signal that balance is off
- The instinct is to want more hours, but 48h days don't exist

## Key Tension

Wanting more time is the symptom, not the problem. The real question: What am I spending time on that isn't essential?

## Questions to Explore

- What activities consume time without delivering real value?
- Am I confusing being busy with being productive?
- What would I cut if I only had 4 hours/day for work?
- Is this a time problem or a priority problem?
- Am I protecting family time like I protect important meetings?

## Content Potential

- **Platform:** LinkedIn
- **Format:** Personal reflection post / founder vulnerability
- **Angle:** "The 48-hour day myth" or "Your calendar reflects your real priorities"
