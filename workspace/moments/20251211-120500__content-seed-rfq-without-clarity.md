# Future Founders: If You Don't Know WHAT and WHY, Don't Ask for a Proposal

## Raw Capture

I am thinking to write a post about topic like: Future Founder: If you don't know WHAT AND WHY, don't ask for a proposal. This is from my experience, we have received many inquiries asking for RFQ, but what we have is a blank or a single line of ideas "I want to build a product that can do X" or similar. We then spend a lot of time to analyze, breakdown into functions, then estimation and prepare the quotation. They also asked many vendors also. Then what we have is sorry, a direction changed, out of budget, too expensive than what we think, etc. Some is too but some they might pick the cheapest vendor, but you know "you get what you give" - cost vs quality. Vendor vs partnership. If they are clear what and Why, write it down (BRD, PRD or similar), give a budget then ask for RFQ. If they don't even know and they need collaboration, ideas from others, find a trusted partner then start working for a fixed duration then evaluate together.

## Context

- Source: Direct experience running INNOMIZE, receiving RFQs from founders
- Pattern observed: Repeated over multiple years, dozens of inquiries
- Trigger: Frustration with wasted effort on unclear proposals
- Relevance: Helps both founders (get better results) and vendors (filter better)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Problem:** Founders ask for proposals without clarity on WHAT they need or WHY
2. **Vendor pain:** Time spent on analysis, breakdown, estimation for vague requests
3. **Common outcomes:** "Direction changed," "out of budget," "too expensive," or they pick cheapest vendor
4. **Reality:** "You get what you give" - cost vs quality tradeoff
5. **Two paths for founders:**
   - **Path A (Clear):** Know WHAT and WHY → Write BRD/PRD → Set budget → Send RFQ
   - **Path B (Unclear):** Need collaboration → Find trusted partner → Fixed duration engagement → Evaluate together

## Core Argument

The RFQ process is broken when founders don't have clarity. It wastes everyone's time. There are two legitimate approaches:
1. Come prepared with requirements and budget
2. Engage a partner for discovery first

What doesn't work: Shopping for the cheapest bid on a vague idea.

## Content Potential

- **Platform:** LinkedIn
- **Format:** Single post (narrative/experience-driven)
- **Angle:** Founder advice from vendor perspective (contrarian - usually advice goes the other way)
- **Hook options:**
  - "If you don't know WHAT and WHY, don't ask for a proposal."
  - "We've received hundreds of RFQs. Most are a single sentence: 'I want to build X.'"
  - "The cheapest vendor won the bid. Now you know why your product failed."
- **Persona:** Consultant/Advisor (value-focused, problem-solution)

## Key Phrases to Use

- "You get what you give" - cost vs quality
- Vendor vs Partnership mindset
- BRD/PRD before RFQ
- "Direction changed" / "Out of budget" - the ghost responses
- Discovery phase vs Build phase

## Structure Draft

1. **Hook:** Single-line RFQ frustration
2. **Problem:** What we receive (vague requests, multiple vendors)
3. **Outcome:** What happens (wasted time, direction changed, cheapest wins)
4. **Reality check:** Cost vs quality tradeoff
5. **Solution A:** If you know → BRD/PRD → Budget → RFQ
6. **Solution B:** If you don't know → Partner → Discovery phase → Then decide
7. **Close:** Vendor ≠ Partner. Choose which you need.

- Could expand into article with examples (anonymized)
- Could pair with "How to write a good BRD for tech projects" as follow-up post
- Related to embedded CTO positioning (we're the partner option)
