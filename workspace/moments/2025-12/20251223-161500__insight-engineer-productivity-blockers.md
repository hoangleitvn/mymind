# Engineer productivity blockers: it's not code speed

## Raw Capture

From my experience, most engineers stuck not because they cannot write code fast. They stuck or low productivity because:

1. They lack of design system or architecture skills
2. They lack of communication and soft skill
3. They lack of think in system skill
4. They lack of problem resolving skill
5. Buy AI is easy, but train them how to use AI is a different problem
6. Write code is easy, but validate it is hard even with AI - do you trust AI validation result?

So train your team, build the system where AI can bring benefit. It is a bit slowly but it will compound overtime.

Or you ask them to use AI - speed is wow but your system will be broken when users use it (at night).

Build the system, improve the architecture and think in system then AI will ACE.

## Extracted Context

- **Key takeaway:** Engineer productivity isn't bottlenecked by coding speed. It's bottlenecked by architecture thinking, communication, systems thinking, and problem-solving. AI amplifies these gaps. Buying AI tools is easy. Training people to use them effectively is the real challenge.
- **Why it matters:** Companies throw AI tools at teams expecting productivity gains. Without foundational skills, AI just creates faster messes. The compound effect only works when the system is solid first.
- **Content potential:** Strong LinkedIn post or article. Contrarian angle: "Your team doesn't need faster coding. They need better thinking." Could be a series on each blocker.

## Key Points (structured)

**The 6 real blockers:**
1. Architecture/design skills gap
2. Communication/soft skills gap
3. Systems thinking gap
4. Problem-solving gap
5. AI training gap (buying vs enabling)
6. Validation gap (trusting AI output)

**The choice:**
- Fast path: Give AI tools → speed now → broken systems at night
- Compound path: Train team → build systems → AI accelerates solid foundation

**Core thesis:** Build the system, improve the architecture, think in systems. Then AI will ACE.
