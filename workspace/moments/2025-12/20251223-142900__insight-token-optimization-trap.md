# Token optimization creates token bloat

## Raw Capture

I expect optimize token, so I write instruction and AI continue that loop and add a lof of instructions that increase my agent skills instructions that then increase token usage. This is overthinking, this is prepature optimization.

## Extracted Context

- **Key takeaway:** Trying to optimize AI token usage by writing detailed instructions often backfires. The instructions themselves grow complex, AI adds more instructions, and total token usage increases. The optimization creates the problem it tried to solve.
- **Why it matters:** Self-defeating loop that wastes time and tokens. The "fix" becomes the problem. Classic premature optimization trap applied to AI workflows.
- **Content potential:** LinkedIn - contrarian take on AI prompt optimization. "Stop optimizing your AI instructions" angle. Resonates with engineers who overthink prompts.
