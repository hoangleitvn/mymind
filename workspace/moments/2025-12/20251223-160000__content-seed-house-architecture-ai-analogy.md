# House architecture analogy for AI coding

## Raw Capture

When building a new house, you start with architecture first. Then get the engineer or even 3D printer.

So why don't you do it with AI?

What if you build a house, then use AI to repair your houses when you are living in the house?

## Extracted Context

- **Key takeaway:** Nobody builds a house by starting construction and fixing problems as they go. You design the architecture first. Same principle applies to AI coding: architecture before execution.
- **Why it matters:** Simple analogy that makes the abstract concept tangible. Everyone understands house building. The "repair while living in it" image captures exactly what vibe coding feels like.
- **Content potential:** LinkedIn post hook. Strong visual contrast. Could pair with your vibe coding critique content.

## Draft Angles

**Hook option 1:**
```
Nobody builds a house by laying bricks first and figuring out the floor plan later.

So why do we do this with AI coding?
```

**Hook option 2:**
```
Imagine building a house like this:

Start with random rooms. Add walls wherever. Use AI to fix structural problems while you're living in it.

Sounds insane, right?

That's vibe coding.
```

**Hook option 3:**
```
When building a house:
1. Architecture first
2. Engineering plans
3. Then construction (or 3D printing)

When vibe coding:
1. Start coding
2. AI fixes problems
3. Hope it holds together

One of these approaches works.
```
