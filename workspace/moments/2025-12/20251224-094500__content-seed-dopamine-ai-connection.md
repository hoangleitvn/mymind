# Dopamine as AI Connection Point

## Raw Capture

Jasmin mentioned about Dopamine again, I remember I used it in a comment. This is a valuable term and we can link to our content about AI.

## Extracted Context

- **Key takeaway:** "Dopamine" is a recurring theme in business/mindset content that bridges naturally to AI adoption discussions. The chase for quick wins (dopamine hits) mirrors how teams adopt AI tools expecting instant productivity boosts.
- **Why it matters:** Creates content bridge between mainstream business audience (Jasmin's 344K followers) and our AI/engineering positioning. Dopamine framing makes technical concepts accessible.
- **Content potential:** LinkedIn post - "The dopamine trap in AI adoption" or "Why your AI tools feel like a sugar rush"

## Connection Points

- Jasmin's post: Chasing dopamine highs is unsustainable
- Our angle: Teams chase AI tool adoption for quick productivity dopamine, but real value comes from building foundational skills (validation, architecture thinking)
- Bridge: "Money follows value. Velocity follows clarity." → "AI productivity follows understanding."

## Potential Hooks

- "Your team's AI tools are dopamine, not nutrition"
- "The dopamine trap: Why AI tools feel productive but aren't"
- "If you're chasing AI dopamine hits, switch to building AI muscle. Quick wins fade. Skills compound."
