# Stop Vibe Coding, Start Learning (Advice for Juniors)

## Raw Capture

Now people are vibe coding. Some have skill foundations, some just vibe. One prompt and now they're a "builder", "AI Engineer."

My advice to juniors/freshers:
- Stop doing that
- Start doing this

You don't need to watch videos or follow courses. What you need is to change the way you learn.

## The Problem with Vibe Coding

- Juniors prompting AI without understanding what it generates
- Shipping code they can't debug or maintain
- Calling themselves "AI Engineers" or "builders" after one project
- Skipping fundamentals entirely
- No architecture thinking, just prompt → code → deploy

## The Advice: Stop This, Start This

### Stop

- Vibe coding without understanding
- Watching endless tutorials
- Following courses passively
- Copying code you don't understand
- Skipping to "advanced" topics

### Start

1. **Learn basics first**
   - Read the docs of the framework/library you're using
   - Learn programming best practices, clean code
   - Learn architecture (doesn't have to be microservices - monolith/modular is enough)
   - Understand data modeling basics
   - Learn version control properly

2. **Build something real**
   - Look around or ask AI to brainstorm a basic app you can build
   - Yes, you can build with AI - but understand what it generates

3. **Start with architecture, not code**
   - Use AI to describe your idea into a BRD (keep it simple)
   - Ask AI to design architecture with constraints (TypeScript, Supabase, etc.)
   - Architecture needs constraints to be useful

## The Framework: AI-Guided Learning

### Step 1: Define Your Idea
Ask AI to help you write a simple BRD (Business Requirements Document)

### Step 2: Design Architecture
Use this prompt approach:

```
As a Solution Architect expert, help me - a junior developer with zero experience in software development. I have some basic understanding:
- Fundamental 1 (e.g., JavaScript basics)
- Fundamental 2 (e.g., How APIs work)
- Fundamental 3 (e.g., Database concepts)
- Fundamental 4 (e.g., Git basics)

Now I'm starting to build to learn and improve my skills.
- It doesn't have to be perfect
- It doesn't have to be large scale
- It doesn't have to be microservices

What I need:
- Know what I need to learn to do it
- How to design and build the system
- How to utilize AI to speed up while still learning

Here's my BRD of the app I'm going to build. Analyze it and ask me questions to clarify.

Then guide me through architecture design in multiple rounds, using sequential thinking.

Finally, write a full architecture document.
```

### Step 3: Plan the Build
```
Take the BRD and architecture documents → generate a comprehensive plan with roadmap and tasks.

I only have X hours per day, so build a plan to complete the app within Y days.
```

### Step 4: Build with Understanding
- Implement step by step
- When AI generates code, ask it to explain
- Don't copy-paste blindly
- Debug yourself first, then ask AI

## Why This Matters

- AI amplifies what you already know
- If you know nothing, AI amplifies nothing
- Fundamentals compound over time
- Understanding > prompting speed

## The Irony

I'm not an expert at anything (see previous moment). But I understand enough fundamentals to:
- Know what to ask AI
- Validate what AI generates
- Debug when things break
- Design systems that last

That's the difference between vibe coding and building.

## Content Potential

### Post Structure Options

**Option A: Short LinkedIn post**
- Hook: Observation about vibe coding trend
- Problem: What juniors are missing
- Solution: The learning framework
- Close: AI amplifies what you know

**Option B: Long-form / Newsletter**
- Full framework with prompts
- Examples of good vs. vibe coding
