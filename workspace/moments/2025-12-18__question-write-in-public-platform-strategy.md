# Write in Public: Platform Strategy Question

## Raw Capture

How should I structure my "write in public" strategy across platforms?

**Current situation:**
- Medium: Previously used, now blocked in my country
- Dev.to: Previously used, still accessible
- Substack: New, actively considering
- LinkedIn: Primary for networking
- X/Twitter: For sharing, reach

**Core question:** Should I consolidate everything on Substack, or split between Dev.to and Substack?

## Context

- Already know the platform differences
- Concern is about effort vs. impact
- LinkedIn is confirmed as primary networking channel
- Need secondary platforms for: sharing experience, building brand, thought leadership

## Platform Characteristics

| Platform | Audience | Content Type | Ownership | Discovery |
|----------|----------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| **LinkedIn** | Professional network | Short posts, articles | Platform-owned | Algorithm + network |
| **Substack** | Subscribers | Newsletters, essays | You own list | Email + word of mouth |
| **Dev.to** | Developers | Technical tutorials, experiences | Platform-owned | Tags + community |
| **X/Twitter** | Public | Threads, links, engagement | Platform-owned | Algorithm + viral |

## Factors to Consider

**Effort multiplication problem:**
- Cross-posting = 2x formatting work
- Platform-native content performs better
- Time spent managing platforms ≠ time writing

**Audience overlap:**
- Dev.to readers may not subscribe to Substack
- Substack readers may not browse Dev.to
- Different discovery mechanisms

**Content types:**
- Technical deep-dives → Dev.to native audience
- Personal essays, opinions → Substack fits better
- Career/leadership → LinkedIn articles
- Quick takes → X threads

## Technical vs. Essays: Key Differences

### Technical Content
**Purpose:** Teach, solve, demonstrate
**Reader intent:** "I need to do X" or "How does Y work?"

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Problem → Solution → Code → Result |
| **Tone** | Instructional, precise, referenceable |
| **Shelf life** | Can become outdated (versions, APIs change) |
| **Examples** | Code snippets, architecture diagrams, benchmarks |
| **Success metric** | Bookmarks, shares, "this saved me hours" |

**Examples from your context:**
- "How to Set Up Lambda with Aurora DSQL"
- "Serverless Cold Start Optimization: Before and After"
- "Step-by-Step: Deploying Containers on ECS Fargate"
- "Debugging EventBridge Rules: A Practical Guide"

**Where it thrives:** Dev.to, GitHub, Stack Overflow answers


### Essays / Opinion Pieces
**Purpose:** Perspective, insight, provoke thinking
**Reader intent:** "What should I think about X?" or "Why does this matter?"

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Hook → Argument → Evidence → Implication |
| **Tone** | Personal voice, narrative, reflective |
| **Shelf life** | Evergreen (ideas age slower than code) |
| **Examples** | Stories, lessons learned, predictions, contrarian takes |
| **Success metric** | Comments, replies, "I never thought of it that way" |

**Examples from your context:**
- "Why Serverless Won (And Why No One Noticed)"
- "10 Years of Lambda: What I'd Tell My Past Self"
- "The Post-Serverless Era Isn't About Serverless"
- "Stop Optimizing for Costs You Don't Have Yet"

**Where it thrives:** Substack, LinkedIn, personal blogs


### Hybrid Content (Both Technical + Essay)
Some content blends both — uses technical context to make a broader point.

**Examples:**
- "What Our Lambda Bill Taught Us About Team Culture" (technical trigger → leadership lesson)
- "Why I Stopped Using [Tool] After 5 Years" (technical experience → opinion)
- "The Architecture Decision That Cost Us 6 Months" (technical choice → strategic insight)

**These work on:** Either platform, but Substack/LinkedIn for the narrative wrapper

## Possible Strategies

### Strategy 1: Substack as Home Base
- All long-form content on Substack
- Cross-post technical pieces to Dev.to (with canonical link)
- LinkedIn for networking + post snippets
- X for threads + links back

**Pros:** One source of truth, build email list
**Cons:** Miss Dev.to native discovery, extra cross-post effort

### Strategy 2: Content-Type Split
- Technical tutorials → Dev.to
- Essays, opinions, newsletters → Substack
- Both feed into LinkedIn presence

**Pros:** Platform-native content, better discovery
**Cons:** Split audience, two places to maintain

### Strategy 3: Dev.to Primary, Substack for Newsletter
- Dev.to for all articles (technical + experiences)
- Substack purely as weekly/monthly digest newsletter
- Newsletter curates best Dev.to content + exclusive insights

**Pros:** Dev.to handles hosting, Substack handles relationship
**Cons:** Substack feels underutilized

## Self-Hosted Blog Option

Some creators build their own blog/tool instead of using platforms.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Self-hosted** (Ghost, Hugo, Next.js) | Full ownership, custom branding, no platform risk | Requires SEO effort, no built-in discovery, maintenance overhead |
| **Platform** (Substack, Dev.to) | Built-in audience, SEO handled, zero maintenance | Platform dependency, less customization, algorithm changes |

**SEO reality for self-hosted:**
- Takes 6-12 months to build organic traffic
- Requires consistent publishing + backlinks
- Dev.to/Substack rank faster due to domain authority
- Self-hosted works better when you already have audience to bring

**Hybrid approach some creators use:**
- Self-hosted as canonical home (buildsthatlast.com)
- Cross-post to Dev.to/Substack for discovery
- Use platforms to funnel readers to owned property

**Future consideration:**
- Start on platforms (Substack + Dev.to) to build audience
- Migrate to self-hosted once you have subscribers/traffic
- Or use Substack custom domain (buildsthatlast.com) as middle ground


## Current Decision (2025-12-18)

**Split strategy:**
- **Builds That Last (Substack)** → Essays, principles, lessons, opinions, thought leadership
- **Dev.to** → Tutorials, guides, how-tos, technical content
- **LinkedIn** → Primary networking, post snippets, engagement
- **X** → Threads, links, quick takes

**Funnel:**
```
Dev.to (discovery) → BTL Substack (relationship) → Email list (owned)
```

**Rationale:**
- BTL positioning is thought leadership, not tutorials
- Dev.to has native developer discovery
- Substack builds owned email relationship
- Self-hosted deferred until audience established


## Initial Thinking

The real question isn't "which platform" but "what's the primary asset I'm building?"

- If **email list ownership** → Substack as home
- If **developer community presence** → Dev.to as home
- If **professional network** → LinkedIn articles as home

Given Mizestack focus (cloud, serverless, architecture), the audience is developers and tech leaders. Dev.to has native reach for this. But Substack builds owned relationship.

## Questions to Explore

1. What's the effort difference between maintaining two platforms vs. one?
2. Do I want to build an email subscriber list (Substack strength)?
3. Is Dev.to community engagement valuable for Mizestack visibility?
4. Can I automate cross-posting to reduce friction?

## Follow-up

- [ ] Audit successful tech creators' platform strategies
- [ ] Define primary asset goal (email list vs. community presence)
- [ ] Test one month of single-platform focus
- [ ] Evaluate cross-posting tools/workflows
