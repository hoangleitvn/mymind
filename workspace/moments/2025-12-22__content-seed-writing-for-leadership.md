# Why I Restarted Writing (And The System I Built)

## Raw Capture

Inspired by post about why writing is crucial/must for leadership. Could write about:
- Why I restarted writing
- The system I built to make it sustainable
- Writing as leadership skill

## Content Angles

1. **Personal journey** - Why I stopped, why I restarted, what changed
2. **The system** - How I built a writing system that actually works (Mizemind angle?)
3. **Leadership connection** - Writing forces clarity, builds influence, scales your thinking
4. **Contrarian** - Most leaders don't write because they think they're "too busy" - that's exactly why they should

## Key Points to Explore

- Writing = thinking out loud
- Leaders who write have unfair advantage (ideas spread without them in the room)
- The restart story (what triggered it?)
- System over motivation (what makes it sustainable?)

## Potential Formats

- LinkedIn post (personal story)
- LinkedIn article (deeper system breakdown)
- Series (Part 1: Why, Part 2: How, Part 3: What I learned)
