# My Current Roadmap — Mize Ecosystem

## Raw Capture

Just my thinking - I am building MizeForge, I also have Mize Studio. So my initial plan is to wrap up MizeForge (Phase I), then move to Mize Studio - building branding and website. Then build MizeForge next and release it. Then validation and market-kit are the next things. FYI, I am also building a BrickMaster AI game as well -> this could be free but I hope this could viral so we can promote our companies (this is my hope).

## Clarification (Added Context)

Mize Studio is a brand/company under INNOMIZE — the product development arm. The website is a container to introduce products (MizeForge, MizeStack, etc.), not "branding before product." Also doing ongoing INNOMIZE IT consulting work — this is revenue work that runs in parallel.

## Company Structure

```
INNOMIZE (Parent Company)
├── IT Consulting           ← Revenue work, ongoing
└── Mize Studio (Brand)     ← Product development arm
    ├── Website             ← Container for products
    ├── MizeForge           ← Content creation tool
    ├── MizeStack           ← Dev framework
    └── BrickMaster AI      ← Viral growth play
```

## Current Roadmap

```
1. MizeForge Phase I     → Wrap up (current)
2. Mize Studio Website   → Product container
3. MizeForge Phase II    → Build + release
4. Validation + Market   → Market-kit
5. BrickMaster AI        → Free game, viral hope → company promotion
```

**Running in parallel:** INNOMIZE IT consulting (revenue)

## The Real Load

| Stream | Type | Priority |
|--------|------|----------|
| INNOMIZE consulting | Revenue (must do) | Ongoing |
| Mize Studio website | Foundation (do once) | Near-term |
| MizeForge | Product (in progress) | Primary focus |
| MizeStack | Product (planned) | Future |
| BrickMaster AI | Growth bet (in progress) | Parallel |

## The Core Tension

Not "5 projects, 1 person."

It's: **Revenue work (INNOMIZE consulting) vs. Product work (Mize Studio ecosystem).**

- Consulting pays now
- Products pay later
- Both need time
- Wife sees constant work

This is the classic founder squeeze: funding the future while serving the present.

## Observations

### What's Working
- Clear sequence thinking
- Awareness of dependencies
- Multiple angles to market (content, branding, viral game)
- Mize Studio as product container makes sense

### Tensions to Watch

1. **Consulting vs. product time** — Revenue work will always feel urgent
2. **BrickMaster = side quest?** — "Hope for viral" is not a strategy
3. **No ship dates** — Phases without deadlines drift indefinitely
4. **Phase I scope undefined** — Without definition, "wrap up" means nothing

### Connection to Earlier Moments

- **Time moment (20251128-120000):** Wife complaining, wishing for 48h → Consulting + product work competing
- **Ship fast moment (20251128-120500):** Building without releasing → No clear Phase I completion criteria

## Key Questions

1. What defines "MizeForge Phase I complete"?
2. How much time goes to consulting vs. product work weekly?
3. Is BrickMaster aligned with "avoid side quests" or is it strategic?
4. What's the ONE thing that moves everything else forward?

## The Hard Truth

If consulting takes 60% of time and you're building 4 products with the remaining 40%, something will slip. Usually it's:
- Family time (moment 1)
- Ship dates (moment 2)
- Or both

**Possible reframes:**
- Block specific days for product work (not hours — days)
- Define Phase I as 3 features max, ship when those work
- BrickMaster: Strategic bet or procrastination project? Be honest.

## Content Potential

- **Platform:** LinkedIn
- **Format:** Founder transparency / dual-track founder life
- **Angles:**
  - "Running consulting while building products — the founder squeeze"
  - "Revenue work vs. future work: how I (try to) balance"
  - "I mapped my workload. It explained everything."
- **Related principle:** "Avoid side quests. Don't fix every problem."

## Follow-up

- [ ] Define: What is MizeForge Phase I scope (3-5 bullet max)?
- [ ] Audit: How much time goes to consulting vs. products weekly?
- [ ] Decide: Is BrickMaster a side quest or core strategy?
- [ ] Sequence: What's the ONE next milestone?
- [ ] Calendar: When does Phase I ship (date, not "when ready")?
