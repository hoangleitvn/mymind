# AI Engineer vs ML Engineer: Which Role Do You Actually Need?

## Core Idea

The debate around "AI Engineer needs ML background" misses the real question: what role do you actually need for your AI project to succeed in production?

## Key Points from Experience

**Why projects fail (not because of missing ML skills):**
- Product vision unclear
- GTM strategy missing
- No success metrics defined
- No production constraints
- No ownership

**Real examples:**
- Failed projects with 2-3 Masters/PhDs in ML/Data Science. Nobody blamed "bad code" or "weak team."
- Shipped successful AI products with engineers who learned ML on the job.

**The reframe: Systems first, model second**
- Understanding AI-native systems > understanding transformers
- Data pipelines, evaluation, knowing when NOT to use AI

**Hiring clarity:**
- Want ML skills? Hire ML engineers or data scientists. They research and write papers.
- Want production systems? Hire engineers who understand systems, evaluation, deployment.
- The gap: Data scientists rarely ship without engineering help.

## Potential Angles

1. **"Stop hiring for the wrong problem"** - Most AI projects fail upstream, not at the model layer
2. **"Systems first, model second"** - The principle that separates shipped products from demos
3. **"The 90% failure rate isn't a skills problem"** - It's a product/ownership problem
4. **"AI Engineer vs ML Engineer vs Data Scientist"** - Role clarity for founders

## Hook Ideas

- "We've failed AI projects with ML PhDs. We've shipped with engineers who learned ML on the job. The difference wasn't skills."
- "90% of AI projects fail. Not because of weak ML skills."
- "If you want ML skills, hire data scientists. If you want shipped products, hire differently."
