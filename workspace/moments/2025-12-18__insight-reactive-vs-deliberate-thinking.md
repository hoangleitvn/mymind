# Reactive vs Deliberate: The Missing Questions

## Raw Capture

Some people just react, without thinking, brainstorming, planning. They create a plan but no questions have been asked. They start writing code without asking any questions about the design, business, why.

## The Pattern

**Reactive mode:**
- Jump straight to action
- Plan without questioning
- Code without understanding context
- Assume requirements are clear
- Skip the "why" entirely

**Deliberate mode:**
- Pause before acting
- Question before planning
- Understand before building
- Ask about design, business, constraints
- Start with "why" not "what"

## Why This Matters

The gap between good and great engineers isn't technical skill - it's the questions they ask before touching code.

A plan created without questions is just a todo list. It might be efficient at doing the wrong thing.

## Key Questions Missing

Before planning:
- What problem are we actually solving?
- Why does this matter to the business?
- Who is affected?
- What constraints exist?

Before coding:
- What's the design intent?
- Why was it designed this way?
- What trade-offs were made?
- What don't I understand yet?

## Content Potential

**Angles:**
1. "The questions you're not asking before you code"
2. "Plans without questions are just todo lists"
3. "Reactive vs deliberate engineering"
4. "Why senior engineers ask more questions, not fewer"

**Format:** LinkedIn post, potentially series

**Hook ideas:**
- "The fastest path to the wrong solution: start coding immediately"
- "A plan without questions is just a guess with steps"
