# Builds That Last Should Include Team Voices

## Raw Capture

I share many ideas on LinkedIn and Substack, but I don't share enough with our own team. I need to share more internally, motivate them, and get them contributing back. Builds That Last is not only from me - it's from our team. There are many contributors I want to engage.

## Context

- Where: Reflecting on content strategy for Builds That Last
- Trigger: Creating email templates for the newsletter, realizing it's positioned as "from Hoang" only
- Who: INNOMIZE team, potential contributors

## Key Takeaways

1. **Gap identified**: External sharing (LinkedIn, Substack) is active, but internal sharing with the team is missing
2. **Opportunity**: Team members have experiences and lessons that could become content
3. **Motivation angle**: Sharing content internally can inspire and motivate the team
4. **Two-way flow**: Not just sharing TO the team, but getting contributions FROM the team
5. **Brand evolution**: "Builds That Last" could become a collective voice, not just personal brand

## Potential Actions

- [ ] Create internal sharing channel/ritual (Slack, weekly digest, team meeting segment)
- [ ] Invite team members to contribute stories/lessons for the newsletter
- [ ] Feature team member experiences in posts (with attribution)
- [ ] Build a "contributor" system for Builds That Last
- [ ] Share drafts with team for feedback before publishing

## Content Potential

- **Platform**: LinkedIn, Substack, Internal comms
- **Format**:
  - Post about "why I'm opening Builds That Last to contributors"
  - Internal memo to team inviting participation
  - Guest post framework for team members
- **Angle**: From solo thought leader to collective wisdom
- **Related themes**: Leadership, team building, knowledge sharing

## Questions to Explore

- What format works best for internal sharing? (Slack, email, meeting?)
- How to make it easy for team members to contribute without adding burden?
- Should contributors be named or anonymous?
- How to balance personal brand with team contributions?

## Follow-up

- Design a simple contributor framework
- Draft invitation to team
- Consider "Team Insights" section in newsletter
