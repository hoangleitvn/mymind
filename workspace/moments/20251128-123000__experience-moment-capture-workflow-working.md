# Moment Capture Workflow — Visual Proof It Works

## Raw Capture

Visual proof of the moment capture workflow working while we are coding. Screenshot shows VS Code with 4 moments captured in a single session, organized in the moments folder, following the design spec.

```

- 4 moments captured in one session
- Each follows naming convention: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS__type-slug.md`
- Moments are interconnected (related_moments in frontmatter)
- All created through natural conversation, not forced workflow

## Why This Matters

### Validation Points

1. **Workflow works** — Captured 4 meaningful moments without friction
2. **Design holds** — File structure, naming, frontmatter all followed spec
3. **AI executes correctly** — Claude follows the skill design without errors
4. **Dogfooding success** — Using MizeForge to build MizeForge

### What Was Captured in This Session

| Moment | Type | Topic |
|--------|------|-------|
| 120000 | Question | Time management, work-life balance |
| 120500 | Insight | Ship fast vs ship right tension |
| 121000 | Insight | Roadmap and priorities |
| 122000 | Insight | Architect mindset validation |

**Pattern:** Started with a personal struggle → evolved into strategic clarity → ended with architecture validation.

This is exactly what moment capture is designed to do: catch fleeting thoughts and let patterns emerge.

## Connection to Earlier Moment

This validates moment `20251128-122000` (architect mindset):

> "If we have architecture and structure, then it will be easy to execute even with AI"

Proof: The moment-capture skill followed the design. AI executed within the structure. No rework needed.

## The Meta-Insight

**Building the tool while using the tool.**

- MizeForge's moment-capture skill captured insights about MizeForge
- The workflow validated itself through usage
- Screenshots provide visual proof for future content

## Content Potential

- **Platform:** LinkedIn
- **Format:** Build-in-public / dogfooding story
- **Angles:**
  - "I captured 4 insights in 30 minutes without breaking flow"
  - "Visual proof: my AI workflow actually works"
  - "Building the tool while using the tool"
  - "What dogfooding your own product teaches you"
- **Hook type:** Show, don't tell (visual proof)
- **Attachment:** Include screenshot in post

## Follow-up

- [ ] Save screenshot to workspace for future reference
- [ ] Consider: Weekly moment review workflow
- [ ] Write: Content about dogfooding MizeForge
- [ ] Add: Screenshot attachment feature to moment-capture skill?
