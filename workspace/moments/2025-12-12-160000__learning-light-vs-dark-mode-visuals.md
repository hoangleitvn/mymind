# Light vs Dark Mode Visual Selection Guide

## The Learning

Theme selection depends on content type, platform, and audience context—not just brand preference.

## When to Use Light Mode

- Educational or professional tone
- Maximum readability and clarity
- LinkedIn (defaults to light interface)
- Clean, minimal, modern look
- Text-heavy content (dark text on white reads better in most lighting)

**Best for:** LinkedIn posts, whitepapers, infographics, tutorials, data-driven content

## When to Use Dark Mode

- Bold, scroll-stopping visual needed
- Substack or blogs (users may use dark mode by default)
- Techy, sleek, or premium brand aesthetic
- Image/graphic-heavy, not text-dense
- Storytelling or emotional pieces

**Best for:** Story-driven posts, tech content, product mockups, personal insights

## Decision Framework

| Factor | Light | Dark |
|--------|-------|------|
| Platform | LinkedIn | Substack, Twitter/X |
| Content | Educational, text-heavy | Emotional, story-driven |
| Goal | Readability, clarity | Scroll-stopping, bold |
| Aesthetic | Professional, clean | Premium, techy |

## Practical Application

For content that lives on multiple platforms: create both versions and test performance.

- LinkedIn primary → Light mode
- Substack/Twitter repurpose → Dark mode variant
