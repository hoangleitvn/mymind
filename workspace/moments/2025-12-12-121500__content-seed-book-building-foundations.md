# Book Idea: Building Foundations for Software That Lasts

## Raw Capture

Saw a book, triggered the idea: write a book about building foundations for software that lasts. Timeline: next few months. Need to research if similar books exist.

## The Idea

A book that captures the core philosophy behind "Builds That Last":
- Foundation-first approach to software development
- Engineering leadership principles from 15+ years experience
- Why most software fails to last (and how to build differently)
- Practical principles, not abstract theory

## Potential Structure (Early Thoughts)

1. Why foundations matter
2. The 15 principles (expanded)
3. Real stories from 50+ projects
4. Team and leadership foundations
5. Architecture that endures
6. Shipping vs. building to last

## Questions to Answer

- What similar books exist? (Research needed)
- What's the unique angle vs. existing books?
- Self-publish or traditional?
- How does this connect to Builds That Last newsletter?
- Timeline realistic for "next few months"?

## Content Potential

- **Format**: Book (primary), excerpts as newsletter content
- **Audience**: Engineers becoming leaders, founders building teams
- **Unique angle**: Practitioner perspective, 50+ real projects, foundation-first philosophy

## Research Needed

- [ ] Search for existing books on software foundations/longevity
- [ ] Identify gaps in current market
- [ ] Define unique positioning

## Follow-up

- Research competing/similar books
- Outline chapter structure
- Decide on publishing approach
