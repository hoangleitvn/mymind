# McKinsey Report: Agents, Robots, and Us

**Report:** Agents, Robots, and Us: Skill Partnerships in the Age of AI
**Publisher:** McKinsey Global Institute
**Released:** November 25, 2025
**Researched:** 2025-12-05


## Why This Matters

This report is trending because it provides nuanced data that counters both the "AI will take all jobs" panic and the "AI is just hype" dismissal. It frames AI adoption as a partnership model, not a replacement model.


## Core Thesis

**AI won't replace workers. It will partner with them.**

The future is a "skills partnership" between humans, AI agents, and robots. The report argues that value comes from redesigning workflows around this partnership, not just automating individual tasks.


## Key Statistics

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Technical automation potential | 57% of US work hours could theoretically be automated |
| AI agents specifically | 44% of work hours (digital/cognitive tasks) |
| Robots specifically | 13% of work hours (physical tasks) |
| Economic value unlock | $2.9 trillion by 2030 (if workflows are redesigned) |
| Companies invested in AI | ~90% |
| Companies seeing measurable gains | Less than 40% |
| Skills overlap | 72% of skills needed for both automatable and non-automatable work |
| AI fluency growth | 7x increase in job postings over 2 years (fastest-growing skill) |


## Skills Analysis

### Skills That Rise in Value

- Problem-solving
- Communication and negotiation
- Leadership and collaboration
- Coaching and empathy
- **AI fluency** (fastest-growing skill)

### Skills Most Exposed to Automation

- Routine digital tasks
- Information processing
- Rules-based work

### The 72% Overlap Finding

> "More than 70 percent of the skills sought by employers today are used in both automatable and non-automatable work."

This means AI fluency + human judgment work together. It's not a binary replacement.


## Job Archetypes

The report classifies ~800 occupations into 7 archetypes:

| Archetype | Description | Automation Exposure |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| People-centric | Healthcare, maintenance, caregiving | Low (~70% of caregiving tasks still require humans) |
| Agent-centric | Digital/cognitive work | High |
| Robot-centric | Physical automation | High |
| Mixed | Human-agent-robot collaboration | Variable |


## The Adoption Gap

**90% of companies invested in AI. Less than 40% report measurable gains.**

Why the gap?

> "Most workflows were designed for a pre-AI world. Applying AI to individual tasks within legacy processes is unlikely to deliver the productivity gains now possible."

### Key Insight

Companies that automate tasks without redesigning workflows get faster at the wrong things. The $2.9 trillion value unlock requires:

1. Redesigning entire workflows (not just tasks)
2. Building human-agent-robot partnerships
3. Investing in AI fluency across the workforce


## Content Angles (For My Positioning)

### 1. Foundation-First Connection

McKinsey's point about legacy workflows aligns with my "work about work" insight. Companies automate tasks but keep broken processes. The overhead remains.

**Angle:** The 90% vs 40% gap is a workflow problem, not a technology problem.

### 2. The Architect vs Bricklayer Framing

From the LinkedIn discussion: "AI is the king of laying bricks, but it fails as the architect."

McKinsey data supports this: routine tasks are automatable, but problem framing, guidance, interpretation, and decision-making remain human.

**Angle:** AI amplifies human judgment. It doesn't replace it.

### 3. The $2.9T Unlock

Value comes from redesigning workflows, not just buying AI tools.

**Angle:** This validates embedded CTO model. Help companies redesign how work happens, not just what tools they use.

### 4. Skills Partnership Model

72% of skills work across both automatable and non-automatable work. The future isn't "AI skills vs human skills" but "AI fluency + human skills together."

**Angle:** Stop asking "Will AI replace X?" Start asking "How do humans and AI work together on X?"


## Quotable Findings

> "Work in the future will be a partnership between people, agents, and robots."

> "A skills partnership is emerging: Machines handle routine tasks while people frame problems, provide guidance to AI agents and robots, interpret results, and make decisions."

> "The AI era is not about replacing the human workforce entirely, but rather shifting the focus of human intelligence from execution to orchestration and judgment."
