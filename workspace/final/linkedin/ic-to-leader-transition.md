The best individual contributor on your team might become your worst manager.

I've seen this pattern repeat for 15 years.

Engineer ships great code. Gets promoted. Keeps shipping code. Team suffers.

The problem: IC success and leadership success require different skills.

As an IC, your value = code you ship.
As a leader, your value = code your team ships.

Math that new leaders miss:

IC working solo: 1x output
Leader still coding full-time + managing: 0.5x code + 0.2x leadership = net negative
Leader enabling 5 engineers: 5x output

The transition requires letting go.

Signs you haven't made the shift:
→ You're the bottleneck for every technical decision
→ Your calendar is meetings but you still code at night
→ Team waits for you to review before shipping anything
→ You fix bugs yourself instead of coaching others

Signs you have:
→ Team ships without you in the room
→ You ask questions more than you give answers
→ Others make decisions you would have made differently, and that's fine
→ Your best work is invisible

Leadership isn't inherited from technical skill.

It's learned. Intentionally.

My first year as a leader, I was still the bottleneck. What's one habit you had to unlearn?
