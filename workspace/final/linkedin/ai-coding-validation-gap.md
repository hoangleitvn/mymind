AI can write code in seconds.

Validating that code? That's where most teams fall apart.

I've watched engineers accept AI suggestions without reading them. Ship to production. Debug for hours.

The code looked right. It wasn't.

AI coding without validation is faster at creating problems.

Checkpoints that actually work:

Before accepting AI code:
→ Read every line (yes, every line)
→ Check edge cases the AI missed
→ Verify it matches your architecture patterns
→ Run tests before committing

After merging:
→ Manual testing on the actual flow
→ Check logs for unexpected behavior
→ Monitor for 24 hours before moving on

What I've learned:

AI is good at: boilerplate, standard patterns, first drafts
AI is bad at: your specific context, edge cases, system integration

The 10% humans add is the difference between code that works and code that ships.

Trust AI for speed. Trust yourself for quality.

How many lines of AI code do you actually read before accepting? Be honest.
