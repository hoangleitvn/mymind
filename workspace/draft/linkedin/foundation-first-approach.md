90% business logic. 10% scaffolding.

That's the ratio I aim for on every project.

Most teams get this backwards.

They skip foundations to "move fast." Then spend 80% of their time fighting infrastructure instead of building features.

The pattern I see constantly:

Week 1-8: Ship MVP with no foundation. "We'll fix it later."
Month 3: 10K users. Auth breaks. Database slows. Deployments take hours.
Month 4-9: Rebuild. 6 months lost. Competitors pass you.

The alternative:

Week 1-3: Build foundations.
→ Auth and authorization (OAuth, RBAC)
→ Database schema and migrations
→ API structure (REST or GraphQL)
→ CI/CD pipeline
→ Monitoring and logging
→ Error handling patterns

Week 4+: Ship features at 2-3x velocity.
→ No infrastructure fights
→ No "how do we deploy this" debates
→ No security patches mid-sprint

The math:

Foundation cost: 2-3 weeks
Rebuild cost: 3-6 months + lost momentum + team burnout

2-3 weeks < 6 months. Every time.

What foundations enable:

✓ New engineers productive in days, not weeks
✓ Features ship without breaking other features
✓ Scale to 100K users without architecture changes
✓ Technical debt stays manageable

This is how I build systems. This is what I implement for every client.

Foundation-first isn't slow. It's the fastest path to sustained velocity.

Skip the foundation, pay later.
Invest in the foundation, compound forever.

What's your current ratio? 90/10 or fighting infrastructure?
