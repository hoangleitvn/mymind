If you can only name one thing you're working on, you haven't planned.

I asked a team member yesterday: "What are you working on and why?"

Silence. Couldn't explain clearly.

"What else is on your list?"

Nothing. Just this one thing.

That's not focus. That's not planning. That's reacting.

Here's what I told him:

If you only have one thing to do, stop doing it.

Start planning. Start prioritizing.

Because "one thing" means you're not thinking ahead. You're just doing whatever appeared in front of you.

Signs you're reacting, not planning:

→ Can't explain what you're doing or why
→ Only one task visible at any time
→ Pick up new work as it appears
→ No sense of what's next
→ Surprised by deadlines

Signs you're actually planning:

→ Can explain current work and why it matters
→ Know what's next after this
→ Chose this task over other options
→ Working toward a goal, not just completing tasks

If you're reacting to whatever appears, switch to planning ahead. Know what's next before you finish what's now.

What's on your list right now?
