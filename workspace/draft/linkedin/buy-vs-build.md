"Why pay $300/month when I can build my own?"

This question is everywhere in my feed. And the math looks tempting.

But here's what the math misses:

That $24K build becomes $24K + ongoing bugs + security patches + "why did it break" debugging sessions + context switching every time something needs fixing.

The real cost isn't the build. It's the ownership.

Every line of code you own needs:
→ Maintenance when dependencies update
→ Debugging when edge cases appear
→ Security reviews when vulnerabilities emerge
→ Documentation for the next person
→ Your attention when it breaks at 2am

SaaS tools externalize that liability. Someone else handles the bugs, updates, and scaling. You pay predictable costs instead of unpredictable ones.

The vibe coding trap: AI makes building easy. It doesn't make ownership cheap.

Here's my decision framework:

Build when:
→ It's core to your value proposition
→ No existing tool fits your workflow
→ You have capacity to maintain it long-term

Buy when:
→ It's commodity functionality (auth, payments, analytics)
→ Existing tools solve 80%+ of your need
→ Your team would rather ship features than maintain tools

Build what differentiates your product. Buy everything else.

What's your buy vs build threshold?
