My DevOps engineer was building an error tracking plugin.

He spent a week studying Sentry's UI. Beautiful dashboards. Smooth animations. Clean design.

Then he started polishing his plugin to match.

One problem: his plugin couldn't send alerts yet.

Beautiful error tracking that doesn't alert anyone is just a pretty graveyard for bugs.

This is premature optimization.

It happens everywhere:

→ Perfecting the landing page before validating the idea
→ Designing the database schema before understanding the queries
→ Building beautiful dashboards before the data pipeline works
→ Polishing UI before core functionality exists

The right order:

1. Make it work (core function that delivers value)
2. Make it right (supporting functions, reliability)
3. Make it beautiful (polish, UI, experience)

Never skip steps 1 and 2 to get to step 3.

My feedback to the engineer:

"Ship alerts first. Even ugly alerts. Then we'll make them beautiful."

An ugly tool that works beats a beautiful tool that doesn't.

What's the most common premature optimization you see?
