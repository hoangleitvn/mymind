The best engineers I know aren't the fastest coders.

They're the ones who leave breadcrumbs.

I've watched teams lose months reverse-engineering systems because nobody wrote down why. The code was there. The context wasn't. The original author? Gone.

That's the difference.

Fast engineers ship features. Great engineers leave a trail.

Here are 10 signs you build to last:

1/ You write the README before the code
↳ If you can't explain it simply, you haven't thought it through.

2/ Your commit messages tell a story
↳ "Fixed bug" wastes time. "Fixed race condition in auth retry flow" saves hours.

3/ You document decisions, not just outcomes
↳ What you rejected matters as much as what you chose.

4/ You explain the "why" behind the "what"
↳ Code shows what. Comments show why. Both matter.

5/ You think about the maintainer in 5 years
↳ That person might be you. Or it might be someone who's never met you.

6/ You treat docs as part of the feature
↳ Undocumented code is unfinished code.

7/ You name things like someone else will read them
↳ Good names are documentation. Bad names are traps.

8/ You write tests that explain intent
↳ Tests are living docs. They show what the code should do.

9/ You leave TODOs with context
↳ "TODO: fix later" is useless. "TODO: handle timeout when API > 5s" is actionable.

10/ You know speed without context is debt
↳ Every hour you "save" skipping docs costs 10 hours later.

Everyone ships fast.
Few build things that outlive them.
