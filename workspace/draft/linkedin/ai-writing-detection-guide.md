# How to Spot AI Writing: The Complete Field Guide

I spent hours analyzing Wikipedia's "Signs of AI Writing" guide. It's the most comprehensive, evidence-based resource on detecting AI-generated content.

Here's everything I learned, organized for writers who want to sound more human and editors who need to spot AI content.

## Why This Matters

AI writing has tells. Specific words. Structural patterns. Formatting habits.

Once you see them, you can't unsee them.

This guide helps you:
→ Write content that sounds authentically human
→ Edit AI drafts to remove obvious markers
→ Detect AI-generated content when reviewing

## The Three Categories of AI Tells

1. **Signature Words** — specific vocabulary AI overuses
2. **Structural Patterns** — how AI organizes ideas
3. **Formatting Habits** — visual and stylistic markers

Let's break down each one.


## Part 1: Signature Words

AI models overuse certain words. Research confirms this across multiple studies. These words appear far more frequently in AI text than in human writing from before 2022.

### Inflated Importance Language

AI loves making everything sound significant.

| AI Says | Humans Say |
|---------|------------|
| stands as a testament to | shows |
| plays a pivotal/crucial role | matters, affects |
| underscores the importance | shows |
| reflects broader trends | relates to |
| watershed moment | major change |
| indelible mark | lasting effect |
| profound heritage | deep history |

**The pattern:** AI adds significance claims to mundane facts. Population data becomes "a testament to growth." Etymology becomes "highlighting the enduring legacy."

### The -ing Filler Problem

AI ends sentences with vague significance claims using present participles.

| AI Pattern | What to Do |
|------------|------------|
| "...ensuring quality standards" | Delete or be specific |
| "...reflecting broader trends" | Delete or name the trends |
| "...emphasizing the importance of" | Delete entirely |
| "...fostering collaboration" | Say what actually happened |
| "...contributing to the ecosystem" | Name the actual contribution |

**Example:**
- AI: "The company launched new products, emphasizing its commitment to innovation."
- Human: "The company launched three new products."

### Overused AI Vocabulary

These words appear far more in AI text than human writing:

**High frequency AI words:**
- Additionally (starting sentences)
- crucial, pivotal, key
- enhance, foster, garner
- delve (pre-2025)
- showcase, underscore, highlight (as verbs)
- landscape, tapestry (as abstract nouns)
- intricate, vibrant, enduring
- testament, interplay
- valuable, align with

**What to use instead:**
- Additionally → Also, And, Plus
- crucial → important
- enhance → improve
- foster → build, grow
- showcase → show
- underscore → emphasize
- landscape → field, space
- tapestry → mix, range
- intricate → complex
- vibrant → active, lively

### Vague Attribution (Weasel Words)

AI attributes claims to unnamed authorities.

| AI Says | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Industry reports suggest" | Which reports? |
| "Experts argue" | Which experts? |
| "Observers have noted" | Who observed? |
| "Some critics argue" | Name them |
| "Has been described as" | By whom? |

**Fix:** Name the source or delete the attribution.

### Promotional Language

AI trained on marketing content sounds like marketing content.

| AI Pattern | Human Alternative |
|------------|-------------------|
| continues to captivate | keeps attracting |
| stunning natural beauty | (describe what's actually beautiful) |
| rich cultural heritage | (name specific traditions) |
| nestled in the heart of | located in |
| boasts a | has |
| must-visit destination | worth visiting |
| breathtaking views | (describe what you actually see) |

### Sycophantic Phrases

AI assistants are trained to be helpful. Sometimes too helpful.

**Remove these entirely:**
- "I hope this helps"
- "Of course!"
- "Certainly!"
- "You're absolutely right!"
- "Would you like me to..."
- "Is there anything else..."
- "Great question!"


## Part 2: Structural Patterns

How AI organizes ideas reveals its nature.

### The Rule of Three

AI overuses triads. Everything comes in threes.

- "X, Y, and Z" structures everywhere
- "adjective, adjective, adjective"
- "short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase"

**Example:**
- AI: "global SEO professionals, marketing experts, and growth hackers"
- Human: "SEO professionals and marketers"

**Fix:** Vary your list lengths. Use two items. Use four. Use five. Three isn't always the right number.

### Negative Parallelism (Most Prominent Tell)

This is the biggest AI marker according to research.

**The pattern:**
- "It's not X, it's Y"
- "Not only... but also..."
- "Not just about... it's..."

**Examples:**
- AI: "This is not just about speed, it's about quality."
- AI: "It's not a mirror but a portal."
- AI: "Not a representation of self, but a mechanism for reinvention."

**Fix:** State directly what something IS. Skip the negation.
- Human: "This improves speed and quality."

### The "Despite Challenges" Formula

AI loves this structure:

1. "Despite its [positive words], [subject] faces challenges..."
2. List of challenges
3. "Despite these challenges, [positive outlook]"

**Example:**
- AI: "Despite its industrial prosperity, the city faces challenges including traffic and pollution. Despite these challenges, the city continues to thrive."

**Fix:** Integrate trade-offs naturally. Don't use the formula.
- Human: "The city's industrial growth created traffic problems."

### Present Participle Endings

AI attaches trailing -ing clauses to make vague significance claims.

**Pattern:** "[Fact], [vague significance]."

**Examples:**
- "...emphasizing the importance of community"
- "...reflecting the continued relevance of tradition"
- "...underscoring its role in the ecosystem"

**Fix:** Delete the trailing clause. End with concrete nouns or verbs.

### False Ranges

AI uses "from X to Y" without logical scale.

**AI:** "from problem-solving and tool-making to scientific discovery and artistic expression"

**Problem:** These aren't endpoints on a scale. They're just a list.

**Fix:** Just list items: "problem-solving, tool-making, scientific discovery, and artistic expression"

### Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)

AI avoids repeating words by cycling through synonyms.

**AI:** "The startup... the company... the organization... the firm... the enterprise..."

**Problem:** This sounds artificial. Humans repeat terms when clarity requires it.

**Fix:** Use the same word when referring to the same thing. Use pronouns naturally.
- Human: "The startup... It... The startup..."


## Part 3: Formatting Habits

Visual patterns that reveal AI authorship.

### Em-Dash Overuse

AI loves em-dashes (—). Uses them where humans would use commas, periods, or parentheses.

**AI:** "Code reviews are broken—most teams do them backwards—and nobody talks about it."

**Fix:** Replace with periods or commas.
- Human: "Code reviews are broken. Most teams do them backwards."

### Title Case in Headings

AI capitalizes All Main Words In Headings.

**AI:** "The Future Of Artificial Intelligence In Healthcare"

**Fix:** Use sentence case.
- Human: "The future of artificial intelligence in healthcare"

### Bolded Bullet Points

AI uses this structure constantly:

**AI:**
- **Scalability:** The system can scale easily...
- **Reliability:** The system is highly reliable...
- **Security:** The system maintains strong security...

**Fix:** Remove inline bold headers. Write plain bullets or use sub-sections.

### Emoji Decoration

AI loves using emojis as bullet points or section markers.

**AI:**
🧠 Cognitive patterns
🚨 Warning signs
🌀 Complex dynamics

**Fix:** Use standard formatting. Save emojis for intentional emphasis.


## Part 4: Quick Detection Checklist

Scan any text for these markers:

### Red Flags (High Confidence AI)

- [ ] "testament to" or "pivotal role"
- [ ] Sentences ending with "...emphasizing the importance of"
- [ ] "It's not X, it's Y" structure
- [ ] "Despite challenges... [positive outlook]"
- [ ] Every list has exactly three items
- [ ] Em-dashes in every paragraph
- [ ] "Industry reports suggest" without naming reports
- [ ] Synonym cycling for the same concept

### Yellow Flags (Check Context)

- [ ] Heavy use of "Additionally," "Furthermore," "Moreover"
- [ ] Words like "crucial," "pivotal," "enhance," "foster"
- [ ] Title Case In Every Heading
- [ ] Bolded inline headers in bullets
- [ ] Generic positive language ("stunning," "breathtaking")

### Green Flags (Human Markers)

- [ ] Specific numbers and data
- [ ] Named sources and people
- [ ] Admitted failures or limitations
- [ ] Sentence fragments for rhythm
- [ ] Repeated terms (not synonym cycling)
- [ ] Honest caveats ("There are catches")
- [ ] Personal stories and dialogue


## Part 5: How to Write More Human

If you use AI for drafting, edit for these patterns.

### Add Specificity

- Replace "significant growth" with "47% growth"
- Replace "experts say" with "[Name] found"
- Replace "recent studies" with "[Study name] in [year]"

### Add Texture

- Include a failure or limitation
- Quote a real conversation
- Name real people, projects, companies
- Add honest caveats

### Remove AI Patterns

- Delete trailing -ing significance claims
- Convert "not X, but Y" to direct statements
- Vary list lengths beyond three
- Replace em-dashes with periods

### Read Aloud

The final test: Does it sound like you talking to a colleague?

If it sounds like a press release, a travel brochure, or a corporate memo, revise.


## Why AI Writes This Way

AI models learn from internet text. That text includes:

- Marketing copy (promotional language)
- Academic papers (hedging, attribution)
- Corporate communications (jargon)
- Wikipedia articles (encyclopedic tone)
- News articles (formula structures)

The model averages these styles. The result: text that sounds generic, positive, and significant—even when discussing mundane topics.

Understanding why helps you edit more effectively.
