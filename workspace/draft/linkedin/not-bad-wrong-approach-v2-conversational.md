You're not bad at this. You're just doing it wrong.

That's what I told my engineer yesterday.

He was stuck. Frustrated. Feeling like he wasn't good enough for the task.

I asked him three questions:

"What are you working on?"
Couldn't explain it clearly.

"What else is on your list?"
Nothing. Just this one thing.

"Do you have a plan?"
Not really.

He can code. He can solve problems. He can ship.

But he wasn't planning. He was just reacting to whatever showed up.

Same person. Wrong approach. Bad results.

So we spent 10 minutes planning.

Now he can explain what he's building and why.
He knows what's next after this task.
He chose this work—didn't just react to it.

Same person. Right approach. Different results.

I've seen this pattern for 15 years.

People think: "I'm not good enough."

Reality: They're doing it wrong.

The developer who can't ship? Can code. Skips planning.

The engineer missing deadlines? Can estimate. Doesn't break down tasks.

The lead who can't delegate? Can trust people. Never actually tried.

The fix isn't "be better."

The fix is "do it differently."

You're probably not bad at your job.

You might just need a different approach.

What's one thing you changed that made everything click?
