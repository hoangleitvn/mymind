Talked with an engineer yesterday about workflow documentation.

His team built a module with 8 people. Now they need to document the workflows.

He started with a status change diagram. Basically a mindmap showing: Draft → Pending → Approved → Published.

I asked: "What triggers the move from Draft to Pending?"

He paused.

Here's what most status diagrams miss:

1. Triggers: What causes the transition?
2. Inputs: What data is required?
3. Conditions: What must be true?
4. Activities: What happens during the transition?
5. Actors: Who performs this action?

A status diagram shows: A → B → C

A workflow doc shows: When [trigger] happens, [actor] can move from A to B if [conditions]. This requires [inputs] and results in [activities].

The difference matters.

Status diagrams are fine for internal alignment. But when you need user guidelines, design docs, or test scenarios, you need the full context.

Here's the approach I recommend:

Write the workflow doc first. Text, not visuals.

Then ask AI to create:
- Status diagrams (simple overview)
- Swimlane diagrams (who does what)
- User documentation (external)
- Test scenarios (edge cases)

One doc becomes the source of truth for everything.

The written doc feeds the visuals. Not the other way around.

What's your documentation-first vs. diagram-first approach?
