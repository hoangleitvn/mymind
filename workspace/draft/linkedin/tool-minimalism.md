I use 3 tools. My competitors use 47.

I ship faster.

Here's why tool minimalism wins.

I see this pattern everywhere. New tool launches, everyone jumps on it. Trending on Twitter? Add it to the stack. Better score on some benchmark? Time to migrate.

Here's the problem: People create tools faster than you can learn, adapt, and optimize them.

You pay more time switching tools than actually using them. ROI drops to zero.

What actually works:

One IDE you know inside out
One database tool you trust
One cloud provider you understand
One LLM that fits your workflow
One machine you've tuned
One agent workflow that delivers
One task at a time
One MCP server solving your real problems
One person you follow and learn from
One specific goal driving decisions

This isn't about limiting yourself. It's about depth over breadth.

When you stick with one tool, you learn its patterns. You build muscle memory. You find shortcuts others miss. You optimize your workflow around it instead of constantly adapting to new interfaces.

The trap: Chasing tools because of new scores or trending topics.

The reality: Explore how other tools solve problems. Then figure out how to apply those patterns to your current stack. That's how you get better without the switching cost.

Be yourself. Don't chase tools because they're new or popular.

Master what you have. Ship what matters.

What's one tool you've mastered that's made a real difference?
