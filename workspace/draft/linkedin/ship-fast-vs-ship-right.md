I preach "ship early, ship smaller."

Here's why I haven't shipped.

I've been building Mizemind for weeks. My identity says "ship fast." My behavior says "still building."

The tension kept me up last night.

Then I realized: "Ship fast" doesn't mean "ship anything."

It means: Ship the smallest thing that proves or disproves your assumption.

The question isn't "Is Mizemind perfect?"
The question is: "What's the smallest version that teaches me something?"

I was confusing speed with recklessness.

Here's how I now decide:

Ship now if:
→ You're building features no one asked for
→ You're polishing instead of validating
→ You've been "almost done" for weeks
→ You can't articulate what's blocking release

Build more if:
→ Core functionality is broken
→ Users will hit dead ends immediately
→ The foundation will require full rewrite
→ You're genuinely learning something new each iteration

The breakthrough: I wasn't avoiding shipping because it wasn't ready.

I was avoiding shipping because feedback is scary.

Ugly but working beats perfect but invisible. Every time.

What principle do you preach but struggle to follow?
