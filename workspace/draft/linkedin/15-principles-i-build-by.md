15 years building products. 50+ projects shipped. These are the principles I keep coming back to.

On Clarity:
→ Build with clarity. When clarity is present, teams move with confidence. When it's absent, speed creates waste.
→ Clarity over speed. Moving fast in the wrong direction compounds mistakes.
→ Build with intention. Nothing should be added unless it supports the desired outcome.

On Structure:
→ Bias for structure. Structured systems scale. Unstructured systems collapse under pressure.
→ Optimize for change. Systems built for change stay relevant. Systems built for the moment decay quickly.
→ Simplicity as advantage. Simple systems ship faster, break less, and are easier to evolve.

On Context:
→ Decisions with context. Pre-PMF choices differ from post-PMF. There are no universal solutions.
→ Think in lifecycles. Some solutions are temporary bridges, others are long-term foundations.

On Outcomes:
→ Outcome over activity. Measure work by what it enables, not what it consumes.
→ Proof, not assumption. Build based on what is true, not what is feared.

On Teams:
→ Enable teams. Your job is to empower, not gatekeep.
→ Remove cognitive load. Free teams to think about business logic, not unnecessary complexity.
→ Culture as infrastructure. Culture determines long-term velocity, quality, and resilience.

On Practice:
→ Document while building. A well-documented system scales beyond individuals.
→ AI as leverage. Use AI as a multiplier, not a substitute.

These aren't rules. They're defaults I return to when making hard decisions.

Which one resonates most with you?
