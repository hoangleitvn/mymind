3 questions I ask to check if my team is planning or just reacting:

1. "What are you working on and why?"

If they can't answer clearly, they haven't planned. They're just doing whatever appeared in front of them.

Clear answer = planned work.
Vague answer = reactive work.

2. "What else is on your list?"

If nothing else, they're not thinking ahead. One task at a time means no prioritization happened.

Multiple items = thinking ahead.
Only one item = just reacting.

3. "What's the most valuable thing you could ship this week?"

This forces prioritization. If they can't answer, they're not thinking about value. They're just completing tasks.

Clear answer = value-driven.
No answer = task-driven.

These questions aren't meant to catch people. They're diagnostic.

If someone can't answer, they need help with planning. Not criticism.

The fix is simple:

Stop. Step back. List everything. Prioritize. Then execute.

Planning isn't overhead. Planning is how you make sure you're building the right thing.

What questions do you ask your team?
