# Design That Disappears: How I'm Building My Second Brain

I've been researching design evolution lately. Here's what I'm seeing:

Design for users → Design that disappears → Design AS user.

The best interfaces don't feel like interfaces. They feel like extensions of how you think.

This is how I'm working now with Mizemind.

I stopped looking for apps to solve my problems. Instead, I built a system. A knowledge base that mirrors how my brain actually works.

Here's the shift:

**Old approach:** Find an app. Learn the app's way of thinking. Adapt my workflow to fit the tool.

**New approach:** Define how I think and work. Build a system around that. Let the tool adapt to me.

The result feels different. When I capture an idea, it goes where it belongs. When I need context, it's already there. When I create content, the system already knows my voice, my themes, my audience.

I'm not using a tool. I'm extending my thinking.

Someone mentioned this could be a "second brain." I think that's close, but not quite right.

A second brain implies backup storage. What I'm building is more like... a thinking partner. A system that doesn't just store what I know, but helps me think through what I'm working on.

The interface is disappearing. What's left is just... working.

That's the design evolution I care about. Not prettier screens. Not more features. Just: less friction between thinking and doing.

Still early. Still building. But the direction feels right.

Design that disappears. Design as user.
