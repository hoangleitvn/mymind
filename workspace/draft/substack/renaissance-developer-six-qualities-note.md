# The Renaissance Developer - Six Qualities

## Note

The Renaissance wasn't about new tools.
It was about a new kind of person.

Werner Vogels just gave developers the same challenge.

At his **final AWS re:Invent keynote**, he introduced **The Renaissance Developer**: six qualities for thriving in the AI age.

**1. Stay Curious**
Never stop asking why. Protect the instinct to take things apart.

**2. Experiment and Fail**
Learn by doing. Accept that experiments fail.

**3. Think in Systems**
See how parts interconnect. Look for feedback loops.

**4. Communicate Clearly**
Express thinking precisely to humans and machines.

**5. Own Quality**
Verify what AI generates. Take responsibility for what ships.

**6. Build T-Shaped Knowledge**
Go deep in your domain. Go broad across disciplines.

The Renaissance masters weren't just painters or just scientists.
Leonardo was an artist, engineer, anatomist, and architect.

The connections between fields created the innovations.

We're in the same moment now.

AI handles the routine.
The new edge is curiosity, systems thinking, and the courage to be a polymath.

**We are the new Renaissance Developers.**

Time to act like it.
