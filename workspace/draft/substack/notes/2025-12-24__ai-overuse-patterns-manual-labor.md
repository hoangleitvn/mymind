# AI Overuse Patterns (Continued)

**Stop using AI as a manual laborer.**

## Pattern #3: Manual Labor (Dec 24, 2025)

I asked AI to rename a variable across 5 files.

What AI did: Opened each file, found the variable, replaced it, showed me the diff. Tokens burned. Time spent reviewing.

What I should have done: Right-click → Rename Symbol. IDE handles it in milliseconds. Zero tokens. Zero review needed.

**The lesson:** AI is a reasoning engine. Stop using it for tasks that require zero reasoning.

## The Hierarchy

Before prompting, ask:

1. Can my IDE do this? (Find/replace, rename, refactor)
2. Can a script do this? (Automation, batch operations)
3. Can I prevent this? (Instructions, templates, rules)
4. Only then: Ask AI

AI should be the last resort for repetitive tasks. First resort for thinking tasks.

**What patterns have you caught yourself in?**
