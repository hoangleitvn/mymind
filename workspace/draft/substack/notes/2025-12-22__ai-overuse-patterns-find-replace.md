# AI Overuse Patterns

**We don't have an AI problem. We have an overuse problem.**

I'm documenting moments where I catch myself (or others) reaching for AI when simpler tools would be faster, safer, and cheaper.

## Pattern #1: Find & Replace

**Dec 22, 2025**

I asked AI to change a few words in my codebase.

What AI did: Wrote a script, scanned the entire codebase, replaced text.

What I should have done: Cmd+Shift+H in VS Code. Find & Replace. Done in 2 seconds.

**The lesson:** IDE features exist for a reason. No tokens burned. No script to review. No chance of AI "improving" something I didn't ask for.

## The Pattern Behind the Patterns

Every overuse has the same root:

- We default to AI instead of thinking first
- We forget the tools we already have
- We treat AI as the first option, not the last resort

AI is powerful. But power without restraint is waste.

**Have you caught yourself overusing AI?**

Reply with your pattern. I'll add the best ones to this running list.

Let's build a collection of "don't do this" moments so we all get better at knowing when NOT to prompt.
