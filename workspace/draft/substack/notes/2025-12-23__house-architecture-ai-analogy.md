Nobody builds a house by laying bricks first and figuring out the floor plan later.

You start with architecture. Then engineering plans. Then construction.

So why do we skip this with AI coding?

I see it constantly: developers prompting their way through features, using AI to fix problems as they appear, hoping the structure holds together.

It's like building a house while living in it, using AI to patch the cracks in real-time.

That's not development. That's damage control.

AI is a powerful construction tool. But it doesn't replace the blueprint. The architecture has to exist first. The specs have to be clear. Then AI becomes 10x more useful because it's executing a plan, not guessing at one.

The uncomfortable truth: if you can't explain the system to AI, you don't understand it well enough to build it.

Architecture first. AI second.
