Most engineers aren't stuck because they code slowly.

They're stuck because of gaps that AI can't fix:

1. Architecture skills - they build features, not systems
2. Communication - they can't explain what they're building or why
3. Systems thinking - they solve the ticket, not the problem
4. Problem-solving - they google answers instead of reasoning through
5. AI training - buying tools is easy, learning to use them is hard
6. Validation - writing code is easy, trusting AI output is dangerous

Companies buy AI licenses expecting 2x productivity. What they get: faster messes.

The compound path is slower: train the team, build the system, improve the architecture. Then AI accelerates a solid foundation instead of a fragile one.

Speed now, broken at night. Or invest now, compound later.

Your choice.
