## Email Body

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

We shipped [FEATURE_NAME] this week. It's live in your account now.

**What it does:** [2-3 SENTENCE FEATURE DESCRIPTION]

**Why it matters for you:** [BENEFIT_Y - be specific about the outcome, not the capability]

Here's the thing. [CONTEXT ABOUT THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES]. We kept hearing this from teams like yours. So we built it.

### What changes

- [SPECIFIC CHANGE 1]
- [SPECIFIC CHANGE 2]
- [SPECIFIC CHANGE 3 - optional]

No migration required. No new setup. It works with what you already have.

### See it in action

I'd like to walk you through [FEATURE_NAME] and show you how it fits your setup. 15 minutes.

## Usage Notes

**Placeholders to replace:**
- `[FEATURE_NAME]` - The feature being announced
- `[BENEFIT_Y]` - Primary benefit (use concrete outcome, not vague value)
- `[WORKFLOW]` - What the customer does that this improves
- `[CUSTOMER_SEGMENT]` - Who this is for (if targeted)
- `[SPECIFIC CHANGE 1-3]` - What actually changes for the user
- `[FIRST_NAME]`, `[SENDER_NAME]`, `[TITLE]` - Personalization

**Voice checklist:**
- [ ] Short sentences (under 12 words average)
- [ ] No banned words (leverage, unlock, empower, game-changer)
- [ ] Concrete benefit, not vague value
- [ ] One clear CTA
- [ ] Reads like a person wrote it

**What to avoid:**
- "We're excited to announce..."
- "This new feature will revolutionize..."
- "Unlock the power of..."
- Lists of 3 adjectives
- Em-dashes
- "Not only... but also..."
