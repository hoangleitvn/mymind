# Stanford CS146S: First End-to-End AI Development Course

**Engineers learning AI development: check out this Stanford course.**

CS146S: The Modern Software Developer

No academic theory. Real use cases.

**The curriculum:**

- Weeks 1-2: LLM fundamentals, prompt engineering, agent architecture
- Weeks 3-5: AI IDEs, terminal automation, context management
- Weeks 6-7: Testing, security, debugging, code review
- Weeks 8-9: UI building, deployment, monitoring

This might be the first university course I've seen that teaches AI development end-to-end. From prompting to production. From code to observability.

**Core philosophy: System first, model second.**

You cannot test, measure, or improve an AI system without proper system design. The model is one component. The system makes it work.

Start learning. Start building.

**You cannot learn without building real software.**
