I just replaced our design team with AI.

One prompt. Working prototype.
A few more prompts. Polished UI.

Best decision ever.

Wait. Not quite.

Here's what actually happened:

AI gave us a working prototype in hours. We tested it with users. Got real feedback. Killed two bad assumptions before spending a dollar on development.

That part? Incredible.

But then we tried to scale it. That's where the cracks showed:

• No design system consistency
• Accessibility? Ignored
• Brand guidelines? What brand guidelines?
• Complex user flows? Broke down fast
• Edge cases? Not even considered

AI is phenomenal for POC and validation. You can test ideas at speed, iterate based on real feedback, and avoid building the wrong thing.

But production? That still needs professional design systems, proper workflows, and people who think in systems, not just screens.

The shift is this:

Designers are moving from pixel-pushing to system architecture. From making things pretty to making things scalable, accessible, and maintainable.

AI handles the first draft. Designers handle the system that lasts.

We're integrating this at INNOMIZE. Use AI for rapid validation. Bring in design systems when you're ready to ship.

I built this app with Gemini 3 and within 10 minutes I have a working POC, then with another hour, I have this now.

The question is not "Will AI replace designers?"

It's "Are you using AI to validate faster so designers can focus on what actually matters?"

What's your approach? Using AI for prototyping yet?
