Recently I have been interviewing a few people.
When I think about hiring, I value mindset first.

Because years of experience do not always mean growth.
You can spend 5 years in a company but only grow as much as a six month intern.
If you do not improve, learn, and push yourself forward, the years do not matter.

That is why I often lean toward the junior with the right mindset over the senior who just stayed. Even if their technical skills are limited, the right mindset means they can learn and improve quickly. Learning tech is easier than unlearning bad habits.

I am not saying I do not prefer senior people. The point is about finding the right people. Mindset, ownership, and continuous learning matter more than just the number of years.

A few questions I like to ask:
 • What soft skill has had the biggest impact on your career?
 • How do you handle feedback vs criticism?
 • What does ownership mean to you?
 • We apply outcomes over outputs. How do you understand that?

For me, the right people are not the ones with the longest CV, but the ones who keep growing.

What is one question you always ask to see if someone has the right mindset?
