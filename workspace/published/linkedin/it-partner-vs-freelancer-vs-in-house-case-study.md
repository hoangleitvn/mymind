Real story: A founder came to us after months stuck with a freelancer team.
❌ Months passed but the MVP never launched
❌ No clear management or focus
❌ Core modules half-finished, momentum gone

We stepped in and shipped the MVP in under a month. Core modules stable, ready for first users.

The difference wasn’t just code. It was focus, process, and alignment.
