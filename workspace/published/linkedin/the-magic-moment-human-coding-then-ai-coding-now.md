A decade ago, I used to write C# code for a couple of hours straight. No testing. No running. Just typing.
Then came the big moment: press F5… and it worked.

Pure magic. Like winning a mini lottery.

Fast forward to now:
I type a prompt, grab a coffee, and vibe coding builds the app for me.

Still magic, just a different flavor.

It’s wild how fast things changed, but that old thrill of seeing something finally run still hits the same.

From late-night debugging to prompt typing, which moment gives you the better vibe?
