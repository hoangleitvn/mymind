I run an engineering team in Vietnam. I refuse to call it outsourcing.

Here's why.

"Outsourcing" comes with baggage:
→ Hourly billing
→ No ownership
→ Your problem, not theirs
→ Endless status meetings with no progress

I've seen it destroy startups. Founders hire a team, burn through runway, and end up with code nobody can maintain.

In 2018, I founded INNOMIZE to do something different.

We don't "outsource." We embed.

What does that mean?

When a founder needs to go from idea to live users, we don't hand them a team and wish them luck. We act as their CTO or VP of Engineering. We own the outcome.

No hourly excuses. No "that's outside scope." No waiting for permission.

Just: ship quality product, get to market, iterate fast.

The difference is accountability.

Traditional outsourcing optimizes for hours billed.
Embedded ownership optimizes for outcomes delivered.

We've shipped 50+ products this way. Vietnam-based team. 50-60% lower cost than US/EU rates.

But the cost savings aren't the point.

The point is: founders get a technical owner who wakes up thinking about their product. Not a vendor who clocks in and out.

If you're building something and need more than just "resources," this is what we do.

What's your experience with outsourcing? Burned or blessed?
