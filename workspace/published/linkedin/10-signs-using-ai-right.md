AI writes code.
Engineers write the rules AI follows.
One skill is free now. The other just got more valuable.

The reality? AI is an amplifier. It makes good engineers faster. It makes gaps visible.

Same principles that separate architects from coders now separate engineers from vibe coders.

Here are 10 signs you're using AI right:

1/ You own the rules before AI writes code
↳ AI executes. You architect. That order matters.

2/ You know "done" before you prompt
↳ Direction first. Generation second.

3/ You ask AI to explain, not just generate
↳ Code you don't understand is debt you can't pay.

4/ You validate before you ship
↳ AI is confident. Confidence isn't correctness.

5/ You can debug what AI produces
↳ When it breaks, and it will, you fix it.

6/ You shape behavior, not just fix output
↳ Stop correcting the same mistakes. Change the instructions.

7/ You turn corrections into rules
↳ Fixed it twice? Document it once. Make the pattern stick.

8/ You treat AI output as a first draft
↳ First attempt, not final answer. You make it yours.

9/ You use AI to go faster, not skip learning
↳ Speed without understanding is borrowed time.

10/ You've said "that's wrong" to AI
↳ And you knew exactly why.

AI speeds up everything. Including how fast your gaps show up.

These aren't new principles. They're architect principles applied to AI.
The mindset doesn't change. The tools do.

I still catch myself skipping 3. Asking AI to explain slows me down.
But the time I save debugging later? Worth it.

Which sign do you practice? Which one do you skip?
