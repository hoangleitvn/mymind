Everyone's vibe coding now.
One prompt. Ship it. Call yourself an AI Engineer.
My advice to juniors: Stop doing that.

You don't need more tutorials.
You don't need another course.

You need to change how you learn.

Here's the problem with vibe coding:

You prompt AI without understanding what it generates.
You ship code you can't debug.
You call yourself a builder after one weekend project.

AI writes your code. But who maintains it when it breaks?

Here's what to do instead:

1. Learn basics first

Read the actual docs of your framework.
Learn clean code principles.
Understand architecture. Monolith is fine. Microservices can wait.
Know how databases work.

2. Build something real

Ask AI to brainstorm a simple app.
Yes, build with AI. But understand what it generates.

3. Start with architecture, not code

Write a simple BRD first.
Design before you prompt.
Ask AI: "Help me design the architecture for this app."
Give it constraints: TypeScript, Supabase, whatever you're learning.

4. Use AI as a teacher, not a replacement

Ask it to explain, not just generate.
Debug yourself first, then ask AI.
When it writes code, ask: "Why this approach?"

The framework:

BRD (what you're building)
 ↓
Architecture (how it fits together)
 ↓
Plan (tasks and sequence)
 ↓
Build (with understanding)

The difference between vibe coding and building:

Vibe coders prompt and pray.
Builders understand what they ship.

I'm not an expert at anything. But I understand enough fundamentals to know what to ask, validate what AI generates, and debug when things break.

That's the difference.

Stop vibe coding.
Start learning.

What fundamentals would you add to this list?
