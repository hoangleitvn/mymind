The engineers who get promoted to leadership? They were already leading before anyone gave them the title.

I've seen this pattern repeatedly: engineers wait for a "leadership role" before demonstrating leadership. They ask for permission to influence, to mentor, to take initiative.

That's backwards. Leadership is a set of behaviors anyone can practice. Title optional.

The engineers who advance fastest don't wait.

They demonstrate leadership behaviors without a title:

→ Take initiative on tasks no one assigned them
→ Influence decisions by preparing better than anyone else
→ Mentor peers informally - share what they learned
→ Own outcomes, not just their piece
→ Communicate proactively, not reactively
→ Hold themselves accountable before anyone asks

Meanwhile, engineers waiting for titles:

→ Do what's assigned
→ Stay silent in decisions
→ Keep knowledge to themselves
→ Say "my part is done" when integration fails

The gap compounds.

In 2 years, one becomes the obvious choice for leadership opportunities. The other is still "great executor, not ready for leadership."

The difference is practice. Did you demonstrate leadership behaviors before anyone gave you the title?

I wrote about the 4 mental shifts from Junior to Management. But this is the enabler: leadership behaviors are available at every level.

You don't need permission. You don't need a title.

Start now. The recognition follows.

What leadership behavior did you practice before you had the title?
