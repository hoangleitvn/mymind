I had this conversation yesterday. I've had it for years.

Daily standup with Duc, our DevOps engineer:

"What did you do yesterday?"
"Research which alert rules and alerting methods are suitable for the error tracking plugin."

"Plan for today?"
"Define alert rules and configure notification in the Grafana Helm chart."

My response: "Where's the design? Show me the workflow."

He said he'd write a simple doc first.

Here's the thing. I don't want formal documentation. I want clarity.

A "simple doc" is:

1-2 pages max. Markdown is fine.
What problem are you solving?
What's your approach?
What decisions did you make and why?
What's the workflow?

That's it.

Without this doc:
- I don't know what you're building
- You might not know either
- We discover misalignment after code is written
- Rework happens

With this doc:
- Alignment before coding
- Forces clarity of thought
- Catches design issues early
- Can review async

The resistance I hear: "I know what I'm building. I don't need to write it down."

The reality: If you can't write it down simply, you don't know it clearly.

30 minutes writing saves hours of rework.

Engineers want to code. Writing feels like overhead.

But writing IS the thinking. Not extra work before the work.

What documentation do you require before coding starts?
