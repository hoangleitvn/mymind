What's the difference between vibe coding and vibe engineering?

Everyone's building fast with AI these days. Vibe coding is trendy. But I'm seeing confusion between two very different approaches.

Vibe coding is exploratory development. It's the spark phase. You're prototyping ideas, testing assumptions, moving fast without heavy documentation. Think of it as sketching before painting. You're feeling out what works.

Vibe engineering is something else entirely.

Here's what I mean:

Vibe coding happens at the code level. You're experimenting with implementations, trying different approaches, seeing what clicks. The AI helps you move fast. You refactor later when patterns emerge.

Vibe engineering happens at the system level. You're designing architectures based on intuition and experience, but that intuition comes from years of understanding how systems behave. You know what scales, what breaks, what creates debt.

The confusion happens when people think vibe coding means no structure. That's wrong.

The reality is different:

Vibe coding works when you have strong engineering fundamentals. The experimentation is guided by experience. You're moving fast, but you know where the guardrails are.

Without those fundamentals? Vibe coding becomes chaos.

Here's when each approach works:

Vibe coding for:
→ Internal MVPs and prototypes
→ Fast iteration on new ideas
→ Exploring solution space
→ Teams with shared context

Vibe engineering for:
→ System architecture decisions
→ Scaling strategies
→ Technical debt management
→ Complex distributed systems

The sweet spot? Use vibe coding to explore. Use vibe engineering to decide. Then structure what you learned.

Most failed projects I've seen tried to vibe code their way to production without engineering thinking. Fast at first. Disaster later.

The developers who succeed with AI? They vibe code with engineering principles. They move fast but know when to slow down and structure.

It's not vibe coding OR engineering. It's vibe coding WITH engineering judgment.

What's your experience? Are you seeing this pattern too?
