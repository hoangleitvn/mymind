AI won't make you an engineer. It will only make you a faster amateur.

Here is why.

"Vibe coding" is the new industry trap. People are prompting once, deploying immediately, and calling themselves "AI Engineers." But there is a massive hidden cost to shipping code you don't understand.

I've seen this pattern repeat all year. When things are "vibing," it's great. But when it breaks? They're stuck. They can't debug what they didn't write, and they can't extend what they don't understand.

What vibe coding looks like:

→ Prompt AI without understanding the output
→ Ship code you can't maintain
→ Skip fundamentals entirely
→ No architecture thinking

What actually works:

→ Learn basics first (docs, clean code, version control)
→ Build something real, not another tutorial
→ Start with architecture, then code
→ When AI generates code, ask it to explain
→ Debug yourself first, then ask AI

The irony: I'm not an expert in everything I build. But I understand enough fundamentals to:

1. Know what to ask AI
2. Validate what AI generates
3. Debug when things break
4. Design systems that last

That's the difference between vibe coding and building.

AI amplifies what you already know. If you know nothing, it amplifies nothing.

If you're vibe coding, switch to learning fundamentals. Make sure there's something to amplify.

The fundamentals compound. The shortcuts don't.
