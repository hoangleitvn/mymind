78% of developers use AI tools.

But here's the surprising part:

52% still don't use agents.

I'm one of them. And I think we're right.

The Data (Stack Overflow 2025)

- 78% use or plan to use AI tools
- Only 23% use agents weekly
- 126% coding speed increase possible with AI

Most developers use AI. Few use agents. The gap is massive.

After 6 months with Claude Code and custom skills, I understand why.

Reason #1: Foundation Missing

Agents amplify your workflow. But if your workflow is messy? Agents amplify the mess.

You need clear requirements, defined standards, and repeatable processes first.

Most teams don't have these yet.

Reason #2: Simple Tools Are Enough

52% of developers stick to simpler AI tools. Not because agents don't work.

Because simple tools handle most needs:
- Code completion
- Documentation generation
- Test writing
- Refactoring assistance

Most work doesn't need autonomous agents. Yet.

Reason #3: ROI Is Unclear

Simple AI tools = 80% benefit, 20% effort
Agents = unclear benefit, 80% effort

For most developers? Easy choice.

What I'm Doing Instead

Building 15 custom skills, not using agents.

Skills are repeatable, predictable, and maintainable.

They handle 80% of my AI needs right now.

When I have solid skills + workflows? Then agents will 10X my output.

But foundation first.

If You're Not Using Agents Yet

You're not behind. You're in the majority.

Build your foundation:
1. Master simple AI tools
2. Create repeatable workflows
3. Build custom skills/prompts
4. Establish standards
5. Then explore agents

Agents will become essential. Just not yet.

Both approaches are right for different stages.

What's your experience? Using agents successfully or waiting like me?
