OpenAI just released a full stack for building AI agents.
AgentKit, Agent Builder, and ChatKit make it easier to design agents that can reason, act, and connect with real systems.

This isn’t another automation tool. It’s a sign that the line between reasoning and execution is starting to blur.
Tools like n8n, Make, or Zapier already do automation well. But OpenAI is adding pieces they don’t cover deeply yet: evals for testing behavior, guardrails for safety, and a connector registry for managing access at scale.

This shift raises a bigger decision for teams, whether to keep logic and orchestration inside existing stacks or start moving them toward LLM-driven platforms like this one.

How do you see this shift changing how teams design and ship AI products?
