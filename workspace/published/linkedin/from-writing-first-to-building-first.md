Companies used to start with docs (writing-first). PRDs, specs, endless notes. 

Now more are shifting to building-first.

Founders start by building. No slides. No specs. Just a working version to test and sell.

A quick prototype can take the same time as writing a doc, but it shows more. How the idea works. How users feel. Where it breaks.

I feel this myself. I’m not a designer. I can’t make things look beautiful. But I know the basics of design. Instead of dragging boxes in Figma, I vibe-code. In an hour, I can have something real to show a team or client. That beats a doc or a slide.

But good software still needs docs. PRDs for what and why. ADRs for how and why. They align people, guide decisions, and reduce tech debt.

Tools make both sides faster now. No-code for non-technical founders. AI coding agents for engineers.

The future of product development isn't "build vs. document." It's about using the right tool at the right time. What's your experience? Have you found a balance between prototyping and documentation?
