Founders, what do you launch with?
- The date you set.
- The money you have left.
- Or the features your first users say they can’t live without?

The core build is almost ready, and you could ship next week. Not perfect, but it works.

Then feedback lands. Early users point out a missing piece that could break the flow. Now you face the choice. Go live with gaps or wait until the experience makes sense.

Time and money are real limits. But an MVP still has to deliver the minimum experience that actually works.

Here’s how I check if a feature is a blocker:
- Does it still solve the core problem without it?
- Will users get stuck if it’s missing?
- Can it be added later without breaking the flow?

How do you decide?
