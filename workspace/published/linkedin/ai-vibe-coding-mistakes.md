A lot of people today are vibe coding builders, AI coding accelerators, or new founders. Some have an engineering background, some don’t.

They start with a no-code tool like Lovable.
They get stuck.
They move on to AI coding agents like Cursor or Clause Code.
They play with CLAUSE.md, Cursor's rules, MCPs, and AGENTS.md, fix things, and within days or weeks, they have a working app.

Payments plugged in with Stripe. Product live. First users onboarded.

At that point, they switch from builder to founder mode. Sales and marketing take over.

Building an app today looks simple. Days, not months.

Years ago, when I started in IT, I was amazed by how websites were built. Now, non-IT people can do it with ease. But building is just the start. Running and growing a product takes years, sometimes decades.

I’ve seen it first-hand. A founder launched their app with Lovable. I unlocked the paid subscription using a test credit card. The app wasn’t ready to scale. Stripe in test mode. Secrets pushed to GitHub. Hackers exploited it. The app collapsed. And many other risks. Time and energy lost.

Writing prompts are easy. But how do you guide an engineering team? How do you ensure best practices, security, and standards?

That’s why vibe coding turns into vibe engineering:
- Build is easy, maintain is hard
- AI can’t fix things when they break
- AI writes code but not architecture
- Scaling needs foundations, not shortcuts
- Humans still need to be in the loop

So the smarter path looks like this:
- Validate with no-code
- Hire engineers for production
- Bring in technical advisors for complex problems and processes
- Fully switch into founder mode

Because building is only step one. Founders need to focus on:
- Product strategy
- Business model
- People and team environment
- User feedback
- Engineering quality and maintainable code

You don’t need to do everything like a CxO. Focus on being a founder. Leave engineering to people you can trust.

If this is the stage you’re in, DM me. We’re not freelancers. We build with accountability, not hourly excuses.
