Great step forward, being able to catch and fix issues right in the terminal makes AI coding agents far more practical. CodeRabbit CLI changes that. It brings senior-level, line-by-line review into your terminal so you can:
- Catch issues before commits/PRs
- Backstop AI output and hallucinations
- Stay in flow (code → review → commit)
- Auto-apply fixes by handing context to AI agents like Claude Code or Cursor

Big step forward from CodeRabbit in making AI coding agents more reliable and practical. Excited to see how this shifts day-to-day dev workflows.
