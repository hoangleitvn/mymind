When building an MVP, you usually face 3 options:
1️⃣ Build it yourself (vibe coding)
 ✔ Full control, fastest, cheapest
 ❌ High risk of rewrites, limited scalability, security concerns

2️⃣ Hire freelancers
 ✔ Flexible, affordable short-term, lower upfront cost
 ❌ Management overhead, lack of ownership, you’re buying hours not outcomes

3️⃣ Work with an IT Partner
 ✔ Structured team, focus on outcomes, long-term alignment
 ❌ Higher upfront cost, but lower long-term risk

The right choice depends on your goals: speed, budget, or long-term growth.

If you had to choose, which path would you take?
