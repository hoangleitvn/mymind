Everyone talks about MCP, Subagents, and Skills.

But the more I work with AI coding assistants, the more I think **Skills are the foundation** we should focus on first.

Here's my thinking:

**Skills = Knowledge base**
- Your architecture patterns
- Engineering principles
- Code standards
- System structure
- Mental models
- and soft skills

When the AI understands these, it doesn't just write code. It makes decisions aligned with how you think.

**Skills help with more than coding**
- Problem-solving approaches
- Decision-making frameworks
- Trade-off evaluation

Once you have strong Skills in place, then workflow and process (Subagents) make sense. Then external integrations (MCP) when you truly need them.

**My current approach:**

I'm spending significant time right now building my knowledge base. Codifying my architecture principles. Structuring my Skills. Teaching the AI how I think, not just what I need.

**But here's my question:**

Is this worth the investment? Or should I skip all this structure and just vibe code—tell the AI what I need and iterate fast?

Part of me wonders: am I over-engineering the setup when I could be shipping code?

Part of me thinks: this upfront investment will pay off exponentially as my system gets smarter.

What do you think?

Are you investing time building Skills and knowledge structure, or are you going straight to vibe coding and figuring it out as you go?

I'd genuinely value your perspective.
