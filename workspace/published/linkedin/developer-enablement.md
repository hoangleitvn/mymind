Developers don't need another status meeting or tool.
They need fewer blockers and clearer context.

That’s what developer enablement is about - creating an environment where engineers can move fast, make smart choices, and stay focused on building.

Leaders can enable developers by:
- Explaining the why, not just the what
- Automating repetitive work and keeping workflows simple
- Trusting engineers with decisions instead of requiring constant approvals
- Fixing systems that slow delivery instead of blaming people
- Building fast feedback loops that improve quality

But developers have a role too. Enablement isn’t one-sided.

Developers can enable themselves and their teams by:
- Asking for context when it’s unclear
- Raising blockers early so they can be solved
- Pushing back when tools or processes create friction
- Giving feedback on what works and what doesn’t
- Taking ownership when trust is given

When both sides commit, engineering culture changes.
Leaders remove friction. Developers step up with clarity and ownership.

The result? Teams that move faster, make better decisions, and actually enjoy the work.

So this week, whether you lead or code, ask yourself: What’s the one change I can make to create more flow?
