Some say it takes "$20 Lovable" on the weekend. Others say it takes months of engineering and $$$$.

The truth? It depends on how you approach it:
- Build it yourself (vibe coding)
- Hire freelancers
- Work with a focused IT partner

Each has a cost — not just money, but time, focus, and long-term scalability.

Curious: what’s the fastest (or cheapest) MVP build you’ve seen?
