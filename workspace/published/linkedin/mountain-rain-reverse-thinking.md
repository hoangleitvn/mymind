You're on a mountain. Heavy rain starts.

Do you go up or down?

I asked my team this question. Both said: "Down. Get off the mountain."

Intuitive answer. But is it right?

Common advice: Go UP. Flash floods collect in valleys. The path down becomes a river.

But here's what most people miss:

It depends.

→ Near the peak? Going up might be faster and safer.
→ Mid-mountain? Evaluate terrain, avoid landslide zones.
→ Near the base? Keep going down, but not through valleys.
→ Your experience and gear? Changes everything.

The real lesson isn't "always go up."

It's: don't follow intuition blindly. Think through consequences.

This applies to work too:

Intuitive: Fix the bug in front of you.
Better question: Is this bug the most important thing right now?

Intuitive: Ship this feature fast.
Better question: What breaks if we ship it incomplete?

Intuitive: Say yes to the client request.
Better question: What are we saying no to by saying yes?

Good decisions aren't about finding the "right rule."

They're about asking: what happens next?

Context changes everything. The answer that saves you today might kill you tomorrow.
