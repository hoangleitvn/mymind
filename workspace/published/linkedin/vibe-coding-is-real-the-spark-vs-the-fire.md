Vibe coding is real.
The flow. The late nights. The instant results.
That moment when everything just “clicks” and the code seems to write itself.

But here’s the hidden truth:
- It feels amazing in the moment.
- It feels painful later when the project grows.

Vibe coding is awesome for prototypes and hackathons.

But when users, investors, or teammates show up, those vibes turn into technical debt.

👉 Vibe coding is the spark. Professional engineering is the fire that keeps it alive.

Have you seen vibe-coded projects collapse once the “vibe” was gone?
