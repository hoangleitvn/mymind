Lovable gets it right. Google AI Studio doesn't.

Here's what I'm talking about: virtual scrolling.

Try typing in AI Studio after a long conversation. You'll be fighting lag instead of building.

After battling unresponsive typing and browser freezes, I dug into the DOM. 

The culprit? Google AI Studio renders your entire chat history - every prompt, every massive AI response - all at once.

No virtual scrolling. Just brute-force rendering of everything from your first message to the current response.

Result: Sluggish typing. Browser freezes. Constant refreshes.

Meanwhile, Lovable handles this perfectly. They use virtual scroll, so only visible messages render.

The irony?

A tech giant missing a basic optimization that smaller teams nail routinely.

This isn't a minor bug. It's a core UX failure that makes AI Studio unusable at scale.

Bottom line: Google AI Studio needs virtual scrolling yesterday.
