Growth in engineering is not only about writing better code. It is about how your focus changes as you take on more responsibility.

At INNOMIZE, we define growth through what you deliver:
✅ Junior delivers a task. Learns fast, executes reliably, grows steadily.
🚀 Middle or Executive delivers a project. Owns delivery, understands scope, coordinates with the team.
🧭 Senior or Lead delivers a standard. Sets best practices, mentors others, and improves processes.
👥 Management delivers a team. Enables people, aligns priorities, drives delivery through others.

Each level builds on the one before it. The more you grow, the more your focus shifts from what you build to how you build to why it matters.

How do you define engineering growth on your team?
