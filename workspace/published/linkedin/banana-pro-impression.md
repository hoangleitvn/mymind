Banana Pro looks impressive.

Sharper images, clean text, real control.

The first version was fun. This one feels ready for actual workflows.

If you work with visuals, ads, branding, or technical diagrams, this is worth paying attention to.

That shift from "interesting experiment" to "ship this to production" is what separates tools that matter.
