BREAKING: OpenAI Releases GPT Image 1.5. Here's what matters.

What's new:
• 4x faster generation
• Better text rendering (denser, smaller text)
• Precise editing (add, subtract, combine, blend elements)
• Consistency across edits (lighting, composition preserved)
• New Images section in ChatGPT sidebar

Available now to all ChatGPT users and via API.

My experience after testing:

✅ Infographics: Strong. Clean layouts, good structure.

⚠️ Editing: Slow, especially with human faces. Expect delays.

⚠️ Text rendering: Still has issues. Content not always preserved. Gemini handles this better in my tests.

I use OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude (primary). Each brings something different. No single tool wins at everything.

Still exploring. Still experimenting. Still learning.

Tools don't matter. Workflow does.

If you work with AI image generation, give it a try and compare.

What's your experience? Which tool handles your use case best?
