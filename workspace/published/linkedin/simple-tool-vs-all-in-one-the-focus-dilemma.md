I like simple tools that do one thing well.
But I also have many tasks, so I end up with many apps. Switching takes time, and complexity shows up.

Then comes the "all-in-one" app. At first it feels like the answer. No more switching. But soon it carries too many features, and the noise takes away the focus.

A good example is in the AI space. Some apps try to bring all the LLMs together in one place to reduce subscriptions and context switching. On the other hand, some apps focus on one use case and do it really well.

So I wonder:
Is it better to have one simple app that does its job best, or one app that tries to cover everything but risks being cluttered?

What do you prefer in your daily work - simple tools or the promise of an all-in-one?
