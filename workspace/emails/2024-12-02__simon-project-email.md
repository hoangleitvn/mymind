**Purpose:** Response to project documentation review, proposal to start collaboration

Hi Simon,

I've reviewed the documentation you shared. The overall direction is clear, though we'll need to collaborate closely to get into the details.

On my end, I have experience designing automated deployment through IaC that can deploy to both Oktik accounts and client accounts if needed. I'm familiar with most of the services involved: DevOps, IaC, Function Apps, Container Apps, Static Web Apps, etc. Some areas are new to me, but I can ramp up quickly.

For the BI piece, I'd suggest we simplify by building a custom UI instead of using PowerBI. It's not user-friendly and hard to customize for this use case. The database per client isn't large enough to justify a full BI solution. Instead, we could build a workflow-driven interface that guides users through Installation → Review → Fix → Migration → Validate, then layer in AI capabilities for synthesis and analysis as the key differentiator.

I'm not sure what your evaluation process looks like, but I have resources available now to get your project moving. We can start building while you're here and shape the team together during that time. Huong and I would be part of the initial core team.

What do you think? Let me know if you'd like another session to discuss how we get started, pricing, and contract details.

Best,
Hoang
