I tell every non-technical founder the same thing: You don't need a CTO to validate your idea. Here’s what you should look for instead.
 
They always give me the same panicked look.
 
"But how will I build my product without a technical co-founder?"
 
Here's what I tell them: Your product isn't code. Your product is a solution to someone's problem. And you can validate that solution without writing a single line of code.
 
One founder came to me recently. She was about to give away 50% equity to someone who could build her app. I asked her a simple question: "Have you proven anyone will pay for this?"
 
She hadn't.
 
So she tested it first. No code. Just manual processes, Google Forms, and Zapier. Within two weeks, she had paying customers.
 
Now she knows exactly what to build. And she can hire developers or bring on a technical co-founder without giving away half her company to someone just because they know React.
 
The tech industry has convinced non-technical founders they're second-class citizens. That they need permission from someone technical to start a company.
 
It's bullshit.
 
You need customers. Not code.
