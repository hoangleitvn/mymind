# UK Client Meeting Prep — Monday Dec 1

## Context
- Client looking to transfer dev team from UK to Vietnam
- Simon has a deck to introduce the platform and requirements
- Key focus: Azure platform adherence to Microsoft standards + Azure DevOps

---

## Pre-Meeting Preparation

### 1. Understand Their Context
- Research their company — What do they build? Current team size in UK?
- Azure stack specifics — What services are they using? (App Services, AKS, Functions, etc.)
- Why transfer? — Cost reduction? Scaling? Both?

### 2. Your Azure & DevOps Credentials
Prepare proof points:
- Projects delivered on Azure (names, scale, outcomes)
- Azure certifications on your team (AZ-104, AZ-400, etc.)
- Azure DevOps workflows you've implemented (CI/CD pipelines, repos, boards)
- Compliance/security standards you follow (SOC2, ISO 27001 if applicable)

### 3. Team Transfer Model Options
Be ready to present:
- **Full transfer** — You absorb and manage their entire dev function
- **Hybrid model** — UK leads stay, VN team executes
- **Gradual transition** — Phased handover with knowledge transfer period

### 4. Key Questions to Ask Simon/Client
- Current team structure and roles?
- Existing documentation and codebase state?
- Timeline expectations for transfer?
- Who owns decisions post-transfer? (embedded CTO or their UK leads?)
- SLA/support expectations?

### 5. Differentiators to Emphasize
- **Embedded ownership, not staff aug** — You own outcomes, not hours
- **Azure DevOps native** — Your team already works this way
- **Timezone overlap** — VN afternoon = UK morning (4-5 hrs overlap)
- **50+ products shipped** — Proven track record
