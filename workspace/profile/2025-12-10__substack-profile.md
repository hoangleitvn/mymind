## Publication Name

### Final Choice

**Name:** Builds That Last

**Alias:** buildsthatlast

**Custom Domain:** buildsthatlast.com (to purchase)

**Backup Domain:** theshippingpractice.com (to purchase)

**Short description:** Building and shipping products with clarity. Engineering leadership, product development, and things that last. By Hoang Le.

**Publication introduction:**
Builds That Last is about building products that endure. Engineering leadership lessons, product development principles, and honest takes on architecture, teams, and execution from 15 years shipping 50+ projects. No theory without proof. No frameworks copied from Twitter. Just what I've learned building things that had to work. Subscribe if you're an engineer becoming a leader, a founder building a technical team, or anyone tired of advice that doesn't ship.

**Character count:** ~480

**Categories:**
- Primary: Technology
- Secondary: Startups or Business

### Taglines

**Primary (covers, headers, social):**
> Everyone ships fast. Few build to last.

**Secondary (About page, intro):**
> In the AI era, shipping is easy. Building to last is what matters.

### Why This Name
- Outcome-focused: emphasizes durability and quality
- "Last" = lasting impact, things that endure
- Short, memorable (4 syllables)
- Stands alone from personal brand (hoangleitvn)
- Separate from company brands (INNOMIZE, Mize*)
- Avoids conflict with shipwithclarity.com (competitor)

### Previous Name (Deprecated)
- **Ship with Clarity** - deprecated due to domain conflict with competitor selling similar frameworks

### Recommended Structure

Hi, I'm Hoang.

Most engineering advice sounds good in theory. It falls apart when you're shipping under pressure.

I've spent 15 years learning what actually lasts.

50+ projects shipped across startups and enterprise. Supply chain, law tech, healthcare, public SaaS. Teams scaled from 0 to 40+ engineers. Clients across US, UK, France, Singapore, and Malaysia.

This newsletter is for engineers and founders who want to build things that last, not things that break.

**What you'll get:**
- Engineering leadership lessons from real projects
- Product development principles that survive contact with reality
- Honest takes on architecture, teams, and shipping

No frameworks copied from Twitter. No theory without proof. Just what I've learned building things that had to work.

**Who this is for:**
- Engineers becoming leaders
- Founders building technical teams
- Anyone tired of advice that doesn't ship

**Who this is NOT for:**
- People looking for quick hacks
- Those who want theory without tradeoffs
