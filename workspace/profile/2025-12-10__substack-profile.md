### Recommended Structure

Hi, I'm Hoang.

Most engineering advice sounds good in theory. It falls apart when you're shipping under pressure.

I've spent 15 years learning what actually works.

50+ projects shipped across startups and enterprise. Supply chain, law tech, healthcare, public SaaS. Teams scaled from 0 to 40+ engineers. Clients across US, UK, France, Singapore, and Malaysia.

This newsletter is for engineers and founders who want to build with clarity, not chaos.

**What you'll get:**
- Engineering leadership lessons from real projects
- Product development principles that survive contact with reality
- Honest takes on architecture, teams, and shipping

No frameworks copied from Twitter. No theory without proof. Just what I've learned building things that had to work.

**Who this is for:**
- Engineers becoming leaders
- Founders building technical teams
- Anyone tired of advice that doesn't ship

**Who this is NOT for:**
- People looking for quick hacks
- Those who want theory without tradeoffs
