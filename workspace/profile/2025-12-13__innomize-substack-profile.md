# INNOMIZE Substack Profile: 2025-12-13

## Summary

**Score: N/A** - Profile optimization in progress

| Section | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Bio | Needs Update | High |
| Profile Photo | Done | High |
| Publication Name | Done | Low |
| About Page | Pending | Medium |
| Content Strategy | Active | Medium |

## Brand Architecture

```
INNOMIZE (company)
├── innomize.substack.com (technical content, software engineering)
├── innomizetech.com (company website, services)
└── Related:
    └── Builds That Last (Hoang Le personal, launching 2026)
```

**INNOMIZE Substack** is company technical content, distinct from personal thought leadership.

---

## Services (Full Scope)

INNOMIZE is not limited to cloud/AWS. Full service offerings:

- **Software Development** (Web & Mobile)
- **Cloud Computing** (multi-vendor, not just AWS)
- **DevOps & Automation Testing**
- **IT Consulting**
- **Offshore Development Center**

Industries served: Supply chain, law tech, healthcare, public SaaS, and more.

## Current State

**Publication Name:** INNOMIZE

**Tagline:** Build better solutions for better lives

**URL:** https://innomize.substack.com

**Launched:** ~2 years ago

---

## Bio

### Current (Needs Update)

```
Engineering leader & founder. 15+ years building products. Helping founders go from zero to live users. Writing about engineering leadership, product development, and building with clarity.
```

**Issue:** This is personal brand copy, not company voice. Identical to Builds That Last.

### Recommended

```
Vietnam-based software development & IT consulting team. 6+ years building web, mobile, and cloud solutions. Practical engineering insights from 50+ projects shipped.
```

**Character count:** ~180

### Why This Works
- Company voice, not personal
- Covers full service range (web, mobile, cloud)
- "Practical" and "shipped" = practitioner credibility
- Doesn't limit to specific tech stack

---

## Publication Details

### Name
**INNOMIZE** (keep as-is, matches company brand)

### Tagline

**Current:** Build better solutions for better lives

**Recommendation:** Keep current tagline - mission-focused, not tech-specific.

### Short Description

```
Practical software engineering insights from a Vietnam-based development team. Web, mobile, cloud, and DevOps lessons from 6+ years and 50+ projects for clients across US, UK, France, Singapore, and Malaysia.
```

## Cross-Promotion Strategy

When Builds That Last launches (2026):

1. **INNOMIZE → BTL:** "For leadership and philosophy insights, follow Hoang's personal newsletter"
2. **BTL → INNOMIZE:** "For technical deep-dives from my team, check out INNOMIZE"
3. **Shared subscribers:** Some overlap expected and encouraged

---

## Action Items

- [ ] Update bio to company voice (recommended version above)
- [ ] Write About page
- [ ] Increase posting frequency (target: 2x/month)
- [ ] Add team contributors (optional - multiple voices)
- [ ] Cross-link with Builds That Last when launched
- [ ] Review and update profile photo (company logo vs personal?)

---

## Profile Photo Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Hoang Le photo | Personal connection, trust | Blurs company/personal line |
| INNOMIZE logo | Clear company brand | Less personal, lower engagement |
| Hoang + "INNOMIZE" text | Hybrid approach | May look cluttered |

**Current:** Hoang Le photo (acceptable for now)

**Recommendation:** Keep personal photo. Company newsletters with founder photos perform better.
