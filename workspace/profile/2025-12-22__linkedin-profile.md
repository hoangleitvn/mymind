## Summary

**Score: 9/10** - Headline, About, Banner, Services, and Skills finalized. Experience and Featured sections pending.

| Section | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Headline | 10/10 | Complete |
| About | 8/10 | Complete |
| Banner | 10/10 | Complete |
| Services | 10/10 | Complete |
| Skills | 10/10 | Complete |
| Experience | 6/10 | High |
| Featured | 4/10 | Low |


## Headline

### Final Selection

**Fractional CTO | Builds that last | Ship fast, scale safely | Cloud, DevSecOps, AI**

### Scoring Breakdown

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity of Role | 10/10 | "Fractional CTO" is precise and well-known |
| Brand Alignment | 10/10 | "Builds that last" = publication name, brand consistency |
| Philosophy | 10/10 | "Ship fast, scale safely" = core tension (speed + quality) |
| Keywords | 10/10 | Cloud, DevSecOps, AI—all searchable technical terms |
| Rhythm | 10/10 | Clean four-part structure: Role, Brand, Philosophy, Skills |
| Character Count | 10/10 | ~78 characters, room to breathe |

### Rationale

- "Fractional CTO" is highly searchable, clear role
- "Builds that last" ties to Substack publication, builds brand recognition
- "Ship fast, scale safely" captures the speed + quality balance (core philosophy)
- "Cloud, DevSecOps, AI" adds technical keyword searchability
- No special characters, clean rendering across all devices

### Previous Version (Dec 22)

"Fractional CTO for Founders | Zero to live users, built to last | 50+ products shipped"

Trade-offs from previous:
- Removed "for Founders" (audience now implicit)
- Removed "50+ products shipped" (proof point moved to About)
- Added technical keywords (Cloud, DevSecOps, AI)
- Added "Ship fast, scale safely" philosophy


## About Section

### Final Version

```
Most founders get stuck between vision and execution.

They have the idea. They have the market insight. What they don't have is a technical leader who acts like an owner, not a vendor billing hours.

I founded INNOMIZE to solve this. I work as your Fractional CTO or VP of Engineering. Not staff augmentation. Not outsourcing with hourly excuses. Accountability-driven development that gets you from zero to live users.

What I bring:
→ 15+ years building engineering teams and products (startups and enterprise)
→ 50+ projects shipped: SaaS platforms, enterprise solutions, custom applications
→ Expertise in cloud architecture (AWS, Azure), system integration, and scaling from MVP to growth
→ A team of 40+ engineers in Vietnam delivering quality at 50-60% of US/EU rates

My approach is foundation-first. 90% of your team's energy goes to business logic, not scaffolding. We build for scale from day one so you don't rebuild after product-market fit.

I work with:
• Technical founders stuck in planning who need to ship
• Non-technical co-founders who need a technical partner they can trust
• Early-stage companies (pre-product to Series A) who can't afford a full-time CTO

The goal is simple: speed to live users with quality that lasts.

If you're building something and need a technical owner (not just a team), let's talk.
