## Bio

### Recommended

```
Engineering leader & founder. 15+ years building products. Helping founders go from zero to live users. Writing about engineering leadership, product development, and builds that last.
```

**Character count:** ~180

### Why This Works
- Clean and scannable
- Positions as practitioner, not guru
- "Builds that last" ties to publication name and core principle
- Works for broader audience (not just founders seeking CTOs)

### Keywords Included
- engineering leader, founder
- building products
- founders, zero to live users
- engineering leadership, product development


## Publication Name

### Final Choice

**Name:** Builds That Last

**Alias:** buildsthatlast.substack.com

**Custom Domain:** buildsthatlast.com (to purchase)

**Backup Domain:** theshippingpractice.com (to purchase)

**Short description:** Building and shipping products with clarity. Engineering leadership, product development, and things that last.

**Publication introduction:**
Builds That Last is about building products that endure. Engineering leadership lessons, product development principles, and honest takes on architecture, teams, and execution from 15 years shipping 50+ projects. Each post comes from something I've built, broken, or fixed. Subscribe if you're an engineer becoming a leader, a founder building a technical team, or anyone tired of advice that doesn't ship.

**Character count:** ~480

**Categories:**
- Primary: Technology
- Secondary: Startups or Business

### Taglines

**Primary (covers, headers, social):**
> Everyone ships fast. Few build to last.

**Secondary (About page, intro):**
> In the AI era, shipping is easy. Building to last is what matters.

### Why This Name
- Outcome-focused: emphasizes durability and quality
- "Last" = lasting impact, things that endure
- Short, memorable (4 syllables)
- Stands alone from personal brand (hoangleitvn)
- Separate from company brands (INNOMIZE, Mize*)
- Avoids conflict with shipwithclarity.com (competitor)

### Previous Name (Deprecated)
- **Ship with Clarity** - deprecated due to domain conflict with competitor selling similar frameworks

### Recommended Structure

Hi, I'm Hoang.

Subscribe if you want engineering insights that actually ship.


Most engineering advice sounds good in theory. It falls apart when you're under pressure to deliver.

I've spent 15 years learning what actually lasts.

50+ projects shipped across startups and enterprise. Supply chain, law tech, healthcare, public SaaS. Teams scaled from 0 to 40+ engineers. Clients across US, UK, France, Singapore, and Malaysia.

This newsletter is for engineers and founders who want to build things that last. Not things that break.

**What you'll get:**
- Engineering leadership lessons from real projects
- Product development principles that work when things go wrong
- Honest takes on architecture, teams, and shipping

Each post comes from something I've built, broken, or fixed.

**Who this is for:**
- Engineers becoming leaders
- Founders building technical teams
- Anyone tired of advice that doesn't ship

**Who this is NOT for:**
- People looking for quick hacks
- Those who want theory without tradeoffs

```


## Principles Page (Draft)

**Purpose:** Codify core beliefs, link to posts that expand each

### Structure

```markdown
# Principles

These are the beliefs that guide everything I write.

1. **Foundation before speed.** Real speed comes from clarity, not from typing faster.

2. **The demo always works.** It's what comes after that separates software that lasts from software that collapses.

3. **Maintenance costs more than building.** Every shortcut in building becomes a tax on every future change.

4. **AI is a turbo, not a robot.** It speeds up what you already have. Good foundation? Faster good software. Bad foundation? Faster bad software.

5. **Knowing ≠ Applying.** The gap between knowing the right way and doing the right way is where most projects fail.

6. **Build for the people who come after.** The engineer who maintains your code in 10 years is your real customer.

[More principles added as I write about them]
