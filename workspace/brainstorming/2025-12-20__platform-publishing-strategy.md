# Multi-Platform Publishing Strategy

## Overview

Strategy for writing in public across multiple platforms with clear separation between personal brand (Hoang Le) and company brand (INNOMIZE).

**Goals (in priority order):**
1. Thought leadership - Build reputation as engineering leader
2. Community building - Build audience for personal brand (BTL)
3. Lead generation - Attract clients for INNOMIZE (follows from 1 & 2)

**Time budget:** ~14-21 hours/week (2-3 hours/day)

**Team:** SDR + Marketing Specialist joining

| Twitter | Hoang Le | Dormant |
| innomizetech.com | INNOMIZE | Active |

---

## Platform Architecture

### Tier 1 - Primary (Your Time)

| Platform | Purpose | Frequency |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| LinkedIn (Personal) | Distribution + engagement | Daily |
| BTL Substack | Thought leadership, owned audience | Weekly |

### Tier 2 - Delegated (Team Time)

| Platform | Purpose | Frequency |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| innomizetech.com/blog | SEO, credibility, lead capture | 2x/month |
| Dev.to | Discovery, broad dev audience | Syndicate from website |
| LinkedIn Company Page | Company content sharing | 2x/month |

### Tier 3 - Minimal/Optional

| Platform | Purpose | Frequency |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Twitter | Auto-syndicate key content | Minimal |
| GitHub | Credibility, not content focus | Maintenance |

---

## Content Architecture

### By Content Type

| Content Type | Platform | Voice | Who |
|--------------|----------|-------|-----|
| Leadership philosophy | BTL + LinkedIn | Personal | You |
| Engineering insights | BTL + LinkedIn | Personal | You |
| Quick takes/hot takes | LinkedIn posts | Personal | You |
| Technical tutorials | Website + Dev.to | Company | Team |
| Architecture deep-dives | Website + Dev.to | Company | Team |
| Case studies (lessons) | BTL | Personal | You |
| Case studies (technical) | Website + Dev.to | Company | Team |
| Company updates | LinkedIn Company Page | Company | Team |

### Content Separation Principle

**Personal (Hoang Le):** Why, philosophy, leadership, lessons learned
**Company (INNOMIZE):** How, tutorials, technical implementation, case studies

---

## Publishing Flows

### Personal Content (You Write)

```
Idea → BTL Substack (full essay)
         ↓
    LinkedIn (teaser post + link to BTL)
         ↓
    3-5 atomic LinkedIn posts (key insights from essay)
         ↓
    Twitter (optional auto-syndicate)
```

**BTL vs LinkedIn Articles:**
- Regular essays: BTL exclusive + LinkedIn teaser (builds email list)
- Cornerstone pieces: Full publish on both (maximum reach)
- Ratio: 80% exclusive / 20% dual-publish

### Company Content (Team Writes)

```
Team writes → innomizetech.com/blog (primary, SEO)
                   ↓
              Dev.to (syndicate 24-48h later, canonical to website)
                   ↓
              LinkedIn Company Page (share with summary)
                   ↓
              You share on personal LinkedIn (optional, with commentary)
```

## Weekly Time Allocation

| Activity | Hours | Frequency |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| BTL essay writing | 4-5h | 1x/week |
| LinkedIn posts | 3-4h | 3-5 posts/week |
| LinkedIn engagement | 3-4h | 30-45 min/day |
| INNOMIZE content oversight | 1-2h | Review + strategy |
| Research/ideation | 2-3h | Reading, noting |
| Scheduling/admin | 1h | Cross-posting |

**Total:** ~14-19 hours/week

### Priority Stack (If Time Constrained)

1. LinkedIn engagement (30 min/day) - compounds fastest
2. LinkedIn posts (3x/week) - visibility
3. BTL essay (weekly or bi-weekly) - depth
4. INNOMIZE review (1h/week) - delegate execution

---

## Team Delegation

### Marketing Specialist

- Write/edit blog posts for innomizetech.com
- Manage Dev.to syndication (canonical links, timing)
- Run LinkedIn Company Page
- Maintain content calendar
- Track content performance metrics

### SDR

- Engage on LinkedIn (company page interactions)
- Distribute content to prospects
- Track leads from content
- Identify content topics from prospect conversations

### You (Hoang)

- Write BTL essays
- Personal LinkedIn engagement + posts
- Review/approve company content
- Content strategy direction
- Thought leadership positioning

---

## INNOMIZE Substack Decision

**Decision:** Archive (Option 1)

**Actions:**
1. Keep existing content live (don't delete)
2. Add pinned note redirecting to Dev.to and website blog
3. Stop publishing new content
4. Export subscriber list for potential website newsletter

**Rationale:**
- Dev.to serves discovery + broad audience better
- Website blog is better for SEO + lead capture
- Substack works best for personal brands (BTL)
- One less platform to manage

---

## Domain Strategy

| Domain | Current Use | Recommended |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| buildsthatlast.com | Planned for BTL | Custom domain for BTL Substack |
| btl.dev | Undefined | Redirect to buildsthatlast.com |
| innomizetech.com | Company website | Add /blog section for content |

**Future option for btl.dev:** Short link service (btl.dev/aws-cost) for tracking shares and analytics.

---

## Twitter Strategy

**Current:** Dormant

**Recommendation:** Minimal syndication

- Auto-share key LinkedIn content via scheduling tool
- Engage 10-15 min when you have momentum
- Revisit in 6 months based on BTL subscriber growth
- Inconsistent presence hurts more than helps

**Decision point:** Re-evaluate Q2 2026 based on BTL growth.

---

## Avoiding Overlap

1. **Voice separation:** Personal (you) vs Company (team)
2. **Content types:** Philosophy on BTL, tutorials on INNOMIZE platforms
3. **Syndication not duplication:** One source, multiple distribution channels
4. **Calendar rhythm:** LinkedIn daily, BTL weekly, INNOMIZE bi-weekly

---

## Quarterly Cadence

| Quarter | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| Q1 2026 | Establish BTL + LinkedIn rhythm, onboard team |
| Q2 2026 | Scale team content, evaluate Twitter activation |
| Q3 2026 | Optimize based on metrics, expand what works |
| Q4 2026 | Review, plan next year |

---

## Success Metrics

### Personal Brand

- BTL subscribers (target: track growth rate)
- LinkedIn followers
- LinkedIn post impressions
- Profile views from target audience

### Company Brand

- Website blog traffic
- Dev.to article views
- Leads from content (track source)
- LinkedIn Company Page engagement

---

## Open Questions

1. Website blog setup - Does innomizetech.com have blog functionality?
2. Content calendar tool - What will team use to coordinate?
3. Dev.to INNOMIZE account - Is it organization account or personal?
4. Analytics - What tools for tracking cross-platform performance?

---

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Finalize BTL Substack setup with buildsthatlast.com domain
2. [ ] Archive INNOMIZE Substack with redirect notice
3. [ ] Set up innomizetech.com/blog if not exists
4. [ ] Create content calendar template for team
