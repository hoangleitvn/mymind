# The Question Gap: When Leaders Wait and Teams Stay Silent

**Created:** 2025-12-10
**Type:** Leadership / Culture / Content Brainstorming
**Status:** Research Complete

---

## The Core Problem

**Situation:** Founder/CEO at Innomize experiencing a culture where team members don't ask questions, leading to zero output and stalled progress.

**Specific Case:** A salesperson who has been with the company for 6 months producing:
- No progress
- No output
- No activity
- No communication
- No thinking
- Nothing to share, debate, adjust, or contribute

**His stated reasons for not asking questions:**
1. "I don't know how to ask questions"
2. "I'm afraid to be blamed"
3. "I'm afraid of working directly with the Founder/CEO"
4. "I think I need to do it by myself"

**The pattern extends beyond one person:**
- Engineering team: Low question-asking
- HR team: Low question-asking
- Accounting team: Low question-asking
- Flat structure provides direct access to CEO
- CEO has explicitly stated "asking questions = collaboration, not weakness"
- Yet... silence across all teams

---

## The Paradox

**Erik Vallart's "80-hour CEO" Framing:**
> "The 80-hour CEO isn't dedicated. They're the dysfunction... Every decision that routes through you is a decision your team waits for. You trained them to wait for you. Then blamed them for waiting."

**The Innomize Reality (Opposite Problem):**
- CEO is NOT the bottleneck (not touching everything)
- CEO is WAITING for input, questions, progress
- Team is NOT engaging, even when given space
- The problem isn't founder control - it's team passivity

**Both extremes fail:**
| Extreme | Description | Outcome |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Bottleneck CEO | Touches everything, makes all decisions | Team waits, doesn't learn |
| Waiting CEO | Waits for input, expects initiative | Team stays silent, no progress |

The missing piece: **A culture of proactive questioning**

## Research: Expert Frameworks

### 1. Amy Edmondson's Psychological Safety

**Source:** [Harvard Business School Research](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Group_Performance/Edmondson%20Psychological%20safety.pdf)

**Definition:** "A shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking."

**The 7 Questions (measuring psychological safety):**
1. If I make a mistake in this team, it is held against me
2. Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues
3. People on this team sometimes reject others for being different
4. It is safe to take a risk in this team
5. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for help
6. No one on this team would deliberately act in a way that undermines my efforts
7. Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are valued and utilized

**Key Insight:** "Inviting participation is the literal act of asking a question. By asking, 'What do you think?' a leader makes it awkward to remain silent."

**But here's the catch:** The founder IS asking and still getting silence. This suggests asking alone isn't enough.

**What the research says is needed:**
> "Employees will only feel comfortable sharing opinions when they've seen a consistent pattern of responsive leadership over the long term."

### 2. Edgar Schein's Humble Inquiry

**Source:** [Psych Safety - Humble Inquiry](https://psychsafety.com/edgar-scheins-humble-inquiry/)

**Definition:** "The fine art of drawing someone out, of asking questions to which you do not already know the answer, of building a relationship based on curiosity and interest in the other person."

**The Problem with Telling:**
> "We fail to notice how often even our questions are just another form of telling—rhetorical or just testing whether what we think is right."

**Why Employees Stay Silent (Schein's research):**
1. "He shoots the messengers"
2. "I used to tell him but he never really took any interest in it"
3. "I tell him but they never fix anything so I no longer have any incentive to tell"

**Relevance to Innomize:**
- Even if the founder doesn't shoot messengers, the CULTURAL expectation (especially in Vietnam) is that bosses do
- Past experiences (with other bosses, other jobs) condition behavior
- The salesperson's "afraid to be blamed" maps directly to #1

### 3. Employee Silence Research

**Source:** [Gallup - Breaking the Workplace Taboo of Silence](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/474236/why-quiet-breaking-workplace-taboo-silence.aspx)

**Drivers of Silence:**
- Fear of negative consequences
- Perceived powerlessness
- Climate of fear or silence
- Organizational hierarchy
- High acceptance of unequal power distribution

**Consequences of Silence:**
- Low retention
- Low trust
- Low creativity
- Low engagement
- Management deprived of critical information

**Key Insight:**
> "Voice is treated as an indicator of employees' commitment and contribution to the organization whereas silence is a symptom of fear, defensiveness, or deviance."

---

### 4. Vietnam's Cultural Context (Hofstede)

**Source:** [VnExpress - The Problem with Vietnam's Culture of Hierarchy](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/perspectives/the-problem-with-vietnam-s-deference-to-hierarchy-seniority-4446507.html)

**High Power Distance Culture:**
- Vietnam scores high on Hofstede's Power Distance Index
- "Authority is never challenged"
- Hierarchical system is deeply ingrained
- Questioning superiors is culturally uncomfortable

**Specific Observations:**
> "Employees do not dare say they like an idea or that it should be implemented; that responsibility rests with the higher-ups."

> "Sometimes at state agencies, employees do not even dare speak their mind because they are afraid of being seen as 'too competent', 'show-offs' or even 'trying to win their boss's seat'."

**Impact on Flat Structure:**
The paradox: A flat structure in a high power distance culture may be MORE intimidating, not less. Employees have direct access to the highest authority = more intimidation, not more comfort.

### 5. Founder Bottleneck vs. Team Dependency

**Source:** [European Business Review - From Bottleneck to Builder](https://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/from-bottleneck-to-builder-why-letting-go-is-a-strategic-leadership-move/)

**How Dependency Forms:**
> "If you complain that people keep coming to you to make decisions or to know what to do, they are not the problem, you are. You've taught them to do that."

**The Flip Side:**
> "When leaders dictate activities and delegate them to subordinates, the person doesn't feel ownership... they're just operating as a remote controlled version of you."

**The Balance Challenge:**
- Delegation is not abdication
- Autonomy without direction = confusion
- Direction without autonomy = dependency
- Need: Clear decision rights + psychological safety to question

## Root Cause Analysis

| Layer | Root Cause | Evidence |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Cultural** | Vietnam's high power distance means questioning authority is unnatural/risky | "Afraid of working directly with founder" |
| **Structural** | Flat structure puts employees directly facing highest authority | More intimidating than hierarchical buffer |
| **Behavioral** | 6 months without established pattern of safe responses | Silence → more silence loop |
| **Individual** | Specific fears (blame, CEO interaction, "do it myself") | Salesperson's own words |
| **Systemic** | Low question-asking across ALL teams | Not a single-person problem |
| **Historical** | Past experiences with other bosses/companies | Cultural conditioning |
| **Clarity** | Unclear on what questions to ask or what progress looks like | "I don't know what I don't know" |

---

## The Deeper Questions

**Questions the founder should explore:**

1. When you explain the WHY after someone asks - do they come back with follow-up questions, or does it end there?

2. Have you ever seen someone get negative consequences (even subtle) for asking a "stupid" question at Innomize?

3. Do people ask questions to EACH OTHER, or is peer-to-peer also quiet?

4. What does the salesperson DO all day if there's no plan, no progress, no communication? Frozen or busy with wrong things?

5. When you receive silence after asking "come up with questions" - what do you do next?

6. What would happen if you said: "No questions means no clarity. No clarity means we pause until we have questions."

---

## Solutions Framework

### Immediate Interventions

| Intervention | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Structured Question Rituals** | Make asking mandatory, not optional. Weekly "what's blocking you?" sessions with required answers. |
| **Written > Verbal** | Vietnamese culture prefers indirect communication. Written channels may feel safer than face-to-face. |
| **Question of the Week** | Assign everyone to bring one question. Normalize questioning as expected behavior. |
| **Model Vulnerability** | Leader asks questions openly, admits uncertainty, shows it's safe. |
| **Celebrate Questions** | Publicly acknowledge good questions, not just good answers. |

### Medium-Term Changes

| Change | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Decision Rights Matrix** | Clarity about who can make which decisions. Reduces fear of overstepping. |
| **Documented Processes** | Reduces "only I can do this" mentality. Makes expectations explicit. |
| **Progress Markers** | Define what "progress" looks like. Daily/weekly check-ins with specific metrics. |
| **Buddy System** | Pair new employees with question-askers. Peer influence may be stronger than leader influence. |

### Cultural Shift (Long-term)

| Shift | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| **Address Cultural Conditioning Directly** | Openly discuss Vietnam's power distance culture and how Innomize wants to be different. |
| **Hiring for Initiative** | Screen for question-asking behavior in interviews. |
| **Consistent Responsiveness** | Build long-term pattern of positive responses to questions. Takes 12-18 months minimum. |

## Content Angles

### Angle A: Personal Founder Reflection
**"I Built a Flat Structure. My Team Still Won't Ask Me Questions."**

- Honest story about expecting autonomy but getting silence
- Explores the gap between access and psychological safety
- Ends with open question, not prescriptive solution
- Vulnerable, not preachy

**Pattern (from Matt Barker framework):** Setup → Unexpected problem → Honest struggle → Open question

---

### Angle B: Two-Sided Framework Post
**"The Question Gap: When Leaders Wait and Teams Stay Silent"**

- Addresses both sides: what founders expect vs. what employees fear
- Include actual quotes (anonymized): "I'm afraid to be blamed"
- Invite dialogue: "What would make YOU ask your CEO a question?"
- Educational, not prescriptive

**Pattern:** Problem statement → Both perspectives → Framework → Engagement question

---

### Angle C: Counter-Narrative to Erik's Post
**"I'm Not the Bottleneck. My Team Just Doesn't Engage."**

- Directly references the 80-hour CEO framing
- Flips it: "What if the problem isn't founder control, but team passivity?"
- More provocative, could spark debate
- Position as "the other side of the coin"

**Pattern:** Reference popular take → Contrarian perspective → Evidence → Question

---

### Angle D: Series (Multiple Posts)

**Post 1 - For Founders:** "Why your open-door policy isn't working"
- Flat structure ≠ psychological safety
- Access ≠ comfort
- The cultural dimension

**Post 2 - For Employees:** "Your silence isn't protecting you - it's stalling you"
- Address the fear directly
- Reframe questions as contribution, not criticism
- The cost of waiting

**Post 3 - For Both:** "Building a question culture"
- Practical rituals
- What works in high power distance environments
- The long-term investment

---

### Angle E: Cultural Context Post
**"Leading in a High Power Distance Culture: The Silence Challenge"**

- Specific to Vietnam/Asia context
- Reference Hofstede's framework
- Practical strategies for leaders in hierarchical cultures
- Unique angle not covered by Western leadership content

**Pattern:** Cultural context → Challenge → What works → Call for experiences

---

## Recommended Approach

**Start with Angle A or B** - Personal, vulnerable, invites engagement without being preachy.

**Why:**
1. Aligns with goal of sharing experience, not selling expertise
2. Creates dialogue opportunity
3. Authentic to real situation
4. Multiple audience appeal (founders, managers, employees)

**Save Angle D (series)** for deeper exploration if first post resonates.

**Angle E** could be a strong differentiator - most leadership content is Western-centric.

---

## Connection to Existing Content

**Erik Vallart Post Engagement (2025-12-10):**

Your draft comment already hints at this:
> "The flip side is harder though. How do you build a culture where teams actually ask questions instead of waiting silently?"

This brainstorming expands that question into full content.

**Potential Thread:**
1. Comment on Erik's post (already drafted)
2. Publish "counter-narrative" post (Angle C)
3. If engagement, develop into series (Angle D)

## Key Quotes to Use

**From Research:**
- "Authority is never challenged" (Vietnam culture)
- "Asking questions becomes more difficult as status increases" (Schein)
- "Silence is a symptom of fear, defensiveness, or deviance" (Employee silence research)
- "You trained them to wait for you. Then blamed them for waiting." (Erik Vallart)

**From the Situation:**
- "I'm afraid to be blamed"
- "I'm afraid of working directly with the Founder/CEO"
- "I think I need to do it by myself"

---

## Open Questions for Further Exploration

1. What specific moment or event might have triggered the silence pattern at Innomize?

2. Are there any team members who DO ask questions? What's different about them?

3. How do other Vietnamese founders handle this? Is there a local community to learn from?

4. Would anonymous feedback channels work, or does that just enable more silence?

5. What's the cost of this silence in concrete terms? Lost revenue, missed opportunities, etc.?
