  key_points:
    - AI generates code/docs faster
    - Now time spent on validating, catching edge cases, ensuring production-readiness
    - Still need to design architecture, figure out patterns, boundaries
    - Shifted from "writing everything" to "architecting and reviewing"
    - Complexity we can handle went up significantly

## Original Post

AI Tools Changed The Work, Not The Workload AI generates code and docs way faster than writing manually. Massive time savings on creation. But now we spend time on different stuff: validating outputs, catching edge cases, making sure generated code actually works in production. And here's what people miss—you still need to design the right architecture. AI pumps out components fast, but someone needs to figure out how they fit together, what patterns make sense, where the boundaries are. Still faster overall. But the work went from "writing everything" to "architecting and reviewing what AI generates, fixing the 10-20% that's off." Different skill set. Different workflow. I see that with the same team, we build systems that would've been impossible before. The complexity we can handle went up significantly. Its worth it. Shipping faster, handling more complexity. Just not the "automate everything" story people sell. #AI #SoftwareEngineering #ProductionAI

    Yes exactly. I have been using cursor and its great and writes code faster than I can but if I dont tell it how to write it and direction it will create the quickest efficient pipeline it thinks we need which may be wrong and inefficient. It also needs guidance on the architecture and business use case and objective.

    This is the L3->L4 shift.

    L3: You tell AI HOW. You've already solved the problem, AI just types.
    L4: You tell AI WHAT + WHY. AI figures out HOW. You review.

    The 10-20% validation becomes the new core skill. Architecture and edge cases don't automate away - they become the primary work.

    "Automate everything" was always the wrong story. "AI handles implementation while you focus on architecture" is closer.

    What's the split looking like for your team now - architecting vs reviewing vs fixing?
  strategy: "Add angle - connect to L3->L4 framework, this is exactly that shift"
```

## Notes

- Realistic take on AI productivity - work changed, not eliminated
- The 10-20% validation is the new core skill
- Connects directly to our L3->L4 framework
- Good reference for AI coding levels content
