## Original Post

Heading to San Francisco in February for a conference. I'm sure there are old friends out there I should catch up with and willl try. But who else should I meet while I'm there. Suggestions on places and people to connect with?

My goals:
1. Talk with more AI aggressive practitioners - the folks who really pushing the boundaries of who we can do with AI to augment and automate.
2. Meet with folks building cuatomer facing agents and thinking hard about guardrails and evaluations.
3. Hear about AI enablement beyond software dev - sre, recruiting, legal, marketing, it's all fair game

I promise to share when we're up to just as much as I'll be listening.
