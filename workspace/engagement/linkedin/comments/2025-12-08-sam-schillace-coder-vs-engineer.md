  key_points:
    - Agentic coding exposes the difference between Coder and Engineer
    - "If your primary value is turning specs into code, the tide is going out"
    - Real engineers understand why, not just how
    - 50x leverage for engineers who get systems thinking
    - AI makes the distinction unavoidable

I've been using AI agents daily for months now.

The pattern is clear: AI handles the "how to write this" part faster than I ever could. But it still needs me to know *what* to build and *why* it matters.

Systems thinking, trade-offs, constraints - that's where the leverage is.
    strategy: "Personal Experience - Share firsthand observation from daily AI coding. Validate his point through lived experience rather than agreement."

## Post Summary

Sam Schillace (Microsoft Deputy CTO) on how agentic coding is exposing the gap between "coders" (translate specs to code) and "engineers" (understand systems, trade-offs, the why). Key message: if code generation is your only value, AI is coming for you. But real engineers get 50x leverage.

## Why Engage

- High-profile voice on AI + engineering future
- Core message aligns with our positioning (systems thinking, ownership, understanding why)
- Sharp line worth amplifying
- Connects to Renaissance Developer themes (curiosity, systems thinking)

## Comment Strategy

Supportive Agreement - quote his strongest line, validate without overexplaining. Match his direct, confident delivery style.
