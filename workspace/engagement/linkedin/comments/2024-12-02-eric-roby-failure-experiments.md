## Original Post

As a backend engineer, I fail … a lot.

But failure isn't always bad.

Every experiment that flops brings insight.

Most great ideas start with experiments.

• I built an API that no one uses.
• I design a database schema that can't scale.
• I refactor code that makes 0 performance difference.

Here's what each failed experiment gave me:

• Clarity on what doesn't work.
• Direction toward the right solution.
• Insights I'd never have found otherwise.

Experience isn't built on perfection.
It's built on experiments.

Each failed attempt sharpens your instincts and helps you build a toolkit for tackling the next challenge more effectively.

    This is the tradeoff most teams miss: over-design upfront to avoid failure, or ship fast and let failures teach you what actually needs to scale.

    The second path is faster. The first feels safer but costs more time.
  strategy: "Expert Insight - Frames the tradeoff clearly, adds practical insight about shipping vs. over-designing."
