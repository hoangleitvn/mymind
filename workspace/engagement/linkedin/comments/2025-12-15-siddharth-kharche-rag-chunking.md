## Original Post

Most RAG failures are chunking failures, not LLM failures. Fixed-size to recursive to semantic to hierarchical chunking. Goal: preserve meaning, improve recall, reduce noise. Good chunking = balance context preservation and retrieval precision.

    Great breakdown. For the research paper use case, what chunking strategy have you found most efficient? Semantic or hierarchical?
  strategy: "Thoughtful question - asks for practical recommendation based on his experience"
```
