## Original Post

I've worked with many different software architectures over the years. One clearly stands out for its benefits. Modular Monolith architecture. Modular monoliths blend the simplicity of traditional monolithic applications with the scalability of microservices. They bring together the best of both worlds. The modular monolith architecture allows you to work in a unified codebase with clearly defined boundaries and independent modules. You can have a high development velocity without the complexity of distributed systems. If you're ready to learn more about: - Modular architecture - Monolith first paradigm - Benefits of a modular monolith - Modular monolith vs microservices Here's how to get started with modular monoliths: https://lnkd.in/eyRyjnfu What if you want to take it further? I have a fully structured resource that shows you: - How to set up a modular monolith from scratch - Explains the different module communication patterns - Demonstrates how to evolve a modular monolith to microservices You can learn more here: https://lnkd.in/eT9354A9 Hope this is helpful! --- Sign up for the .NET Weekly with 75K+ other engineers, and get a free Clean Architecture template: https://lnkd.in/ej4nP9pY

Modular monoliths are a topic I keep coming back to. They are very practical to me, a single codebase with clear boundaries that lets teams move fast without the overhead of distributed systems! Do you find this approach scales well in practice, or do you see any limits as projects grow?

I have been working with Modular Monoliths for a few years. I remember taking Milan's course on building Modular Monolith. It's a pretty long course, and I took a lot from it to improve my own projects. And still, this is the best course I have ever watched on software development.

I have a feeling that the world of software architecture lives in waves. Monolith -> SOA -> Microservice, and so on. Next chapter is SOA again. But I like a modular monolith, too.

One more win: you can map modules to teams, so people ship fast without stepping on each other while you still keep one simple deployment.

Modular monoliths saved us months of infrastructure headaches. Clear module boundaries give you 90% of microservices benefits without the distributed systems tax. The key: enforce boundaries strictly from day one. Retrofitting them later is painful.
