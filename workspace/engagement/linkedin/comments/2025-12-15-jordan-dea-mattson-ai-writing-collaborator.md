I don't want to become a professional writer. I just want to share more effectively.

AI helps me find my blind spots. Patterns I couldn't see in my own writing - same as you, Jordan Dea-Mattson.

I can do it without AI. But it's a matter of time I'd rather spend elsewhere.

Augmentation, not automation. Exactly right. FYI, I haven't thought about setting up the automated write -> publish -> engage workflow yet, and I hope I won't.
    strategy: "Personal experience - connects to Jordan's augmentation framing, honest about goals"
