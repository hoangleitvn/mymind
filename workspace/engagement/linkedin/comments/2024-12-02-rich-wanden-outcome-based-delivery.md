## Original Post

If your budget depends on sprint velocity, you're not in control.

Most clients don't realize this, but velocity was never designed to predict delivery, timelines, or cost. It's an internal dev-team measurement – not a business forecasting tool.

And yet… entire budgets, roadmaps, and board commitments are built on it.

Here's the truth your software partner won't say out loud:
- Velocity protects them.
- Outcomes protect you.

When your delivery model is built around sprints, you get output. But the output doesn't guarantee the thing you actually need: the agreed feature set, delivered when you said it would be, for the price you committed to.

If that sounds familiar, here's why your projects keep slipping:
- Velocity is variable by nature. It was never meant to be stable.
- Sprints reward activity, not completion.
- Estimates carry zero accountability – they're guesses dressed up as process.
- Scope creep becomes a negotiation instead of a contract.

That's how you end up doing the thing every exec hates most: going back to the board to ask for more budget… again.

There is a better way.....Shift from sprint-based billing to outcome-based delivery.

Here's what outcome-based delivery looks like in practice:
1. Define the required outcomes up front – not story points.
2. Fix the price and fix the timeline. No surprises, no ballooning.
3. Tie delivery to milestones, not velocity.
4. Make acceptance criteria objective, not interpretive.

Treat the entire initiative as a product with a completion state, not an endless stream of tickets and sprints.

This is how you as a client can regain control of your budget, your timelines, and your stakeholder confidence.

Because you don't need more velocity.
You need certainty.

This is the shift we made years ago. Velocity-based billing turns every conversation into a negotiation. Outcome-based delivery turns it into partnership.

The clients who stick around are the ones who stopped asking "how many hours?" and started asking "when is it live and working?"
  strategy: "Personal Experience - Directly validates thesis from INNOMIZE experience, adds partnership vs. negotiation framing, reinforces outcome focus."

## Notes

- HIGHLY aligned with INNOMIZE positioning (accountability over hours)
- Good follow target - similar philosophy
- Launching agentic AI platform - potential competitor/collaborator
- Low engagement post (4 reactions) - early comment gets visibility
- Mirrors our outsourcing content themes
