## Original Post

Everyone is starting to sound like ChatGPT. The same robotic tone. Five top tips posts. The "You won't believe this..." posts. You can almost guess the next line before you read it. No value. No texture. No humanity. Just clean, perfectly polished, empty AI slop. AI fatigue is real, people are bored of the sameness, they want to read something that stands out. They want to hear your voice, your mistakes, everything. Here's one way you can cut through the noise: Conversation style posts. They get way more attention than typical posts because they feel more human, like someone is eavesdropping into your conversation. Here's how to write one that actually feels real: Step 1: Pick a real conversation - Choose someone specific, ideally someone important (so people are interested in hearing the outcome). - A founder, customer, mentor, then anchor it around a real insight. Step 2: Jump straight into conflict - Start with the line that captures the conflict. - "Why" questions work well because they create tension. Example: $50M CEO: "Why should I spend money on your sales software? I'm already spending $500k on other tools." Me: "Because you're probably wasting half of that." Step 3: Keep it punchy - Use questions your customers actually have. - Write like you speak. Use short, simple sentences. Step 4: Show the specific outcome, as well as the lesson - End with an action you/they took - Finish with a broader lesson Example: "The lesson? Stay focused on what matters." vs "After this, they dropped 5 tools, kept 3. Close rate jumped from 12% to 31%." Most writing feels generic because it is. Make yours feel unique by writing like you're talking to a friend.

    Such a sharp reminder that originality isn't complicated, it's simply telling the truth the way you would say it. The human voice is still the best differentiator.

    I totally agree. Writing like you speak creates connection. People remember stories, not top tips or empty lists.

    The "economically impossible" framing applies here too.

    Before AI tools, personalized content creation at scale was economically impossible. Now everyone can produce polished posts. But that polished sameness became the new floor, not the ceiling.

    The conversation format works because it's hard to automate authenticity. AI can generate "5 tips" but struggles with the specific moment a $50M CEO pushed back on your pitch.

    Real conversations are content moats.
  strategy: "Expert Insight - Connects to broader economic pattern, adds technical perspective on WHY conversation posts work, introduces 'content moats' business framing"
```

## Notes

- Post is fresh (16 minutes old when captured) - early engagement opportunity
- Will has 422K followers - high visibility engagement
- Topic directly relevant to content creation and AI (our space)
- Conversation post format aligns with our voice (real examples, specific outcomes)
- Leon's comment about AI-like comments is ironic but valid observation
