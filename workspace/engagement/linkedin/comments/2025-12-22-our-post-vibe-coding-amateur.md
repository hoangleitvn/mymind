## Original Post

AI won't make you an engineer. It will only make you a faster amateur. Here is why. "Vibe coding" is the new industry trap. People are prompting once, deploying immediately, and calling themselves "AI Engineers." But there is a massive hidden cost to shipping code you don't understand. I've seen this pattern repeat all year. When things are "vibing," it's great. But when it breaks? They're stuck. They can't debug what they didn't write, and they can't extend what they don't understand. What vibe coding looks like: → Prompt AI without understanding the output → Ship code you can't maintain → Skip fundamentals entirely → No architecture thinking What actually works: → Learn basics first (docs, clean code, version control) → Build something real, not another tutorial → Start with architecture, then code → When AI generates code, ask it to explain → Debug yourself first, then ask AI The irony: I'm not an expert in everything I build. But I understand enough fundamentals to: 1. Know what to ask AI 2. Validate what AI generates 3. Debug when things break 4. Design systems that last That's the difference between vibe coding and building. AI amplifies what you already know. If you know nothing, it amplifies nothing. Stop vibe coding. Start learning. The fundamentals compound. The shortcuts don't.

    Just think it's your reflection. Whatever you feed it. It response same.

    2015: 'I found it on Stack Overflow' 2020: 'I followed a YouTube tutorial' 2025: 'I prompted it and it vibed' The excuses evolve. The inability to debug stays the same.

    Well said. The classic "garbage in, garbage out" still applies. The difference now: AI makes the garbage sound polished. You still need fundamentals to spot it.
  strategy: "Acknowledge and extend - validates their mirror metaphor, adds the GIGO principle, reinforces post's main point"

## Notes

- Our own post on vibe coding critique
- Good engagement with relevant comments
- Karan's mirror metaphor worth expanding on
