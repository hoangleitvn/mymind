I use AI to write. Openly shared why in a recent post.

English isn't my native language. AI removes the barrier between my 15 years of insights and clear communication.

Here is my principal: my judgment, AI's speed.

The question isn't "did you use AI?" It's "does it help someone?"

Both.

I don't just prompt and publish. I write a draft, AI restructures, I read and learn from the changes, then iterate. Over time, my first drafts are getting better. The gap shrinks.

Speed now. Better English later. I don't want to become a writer or a professional writer. I just want to leverage AI so I can share more effectively. I can do it without AI, but it's only a matter of time.

## Post Analysis

Dan takes strong anti-AI writing stance. Comments add nuance (tool vs misuse, write WITH AI). Directly relevant to my published post on AI writing.

## Comment Strategy

Reference my existing public stance. The non-native English speaker angle adds perspective Dan may not have considered. Reframes the question from "authenticity" to "value delivered."
