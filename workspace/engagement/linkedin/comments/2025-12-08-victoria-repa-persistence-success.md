## Original Post

One difference between successful people and most others: How many times they're willing to try. ↳ Most people stop after the first failure. ↳ Some push through a second attempt and give up on the third. ↳ But very few… keep trying until they figure it out. Again and again. Those are the real winners. Success rarely comes from "getting it right" the first time. It comes from failing, adjusting, and trying again. In every way possible. 👉 Try. 👉 Try again. 👉 Try differently. 👉 Try once more. 👉 Try again tomorrow. 👉 Try and ask for help. 👉 Try to fix the problem. 👉 Try to find someone who's already done it. Until you succeed. Because each attempt teaches you something. Each failure sharpens your skills. So next time you feel like giving up, remember: It's not the person who tries once who wins. It's the one who refuses to stop trying.

The people who keep going aren't necessarily more talented, they just understand that failing at attempt at #3 doesn't mean you'll fail at attempt #7. They know that "I can't do this" usually just means "I haven't figured out how to do this yet" Victoria

It's wild how often the breakthrough shows up right after the setback that made you question everything. Consistency has a quiet power most people underestimate.

Success becomes possible when we treat failure as information instead of defeat. Every repeated effort builds clarity about what works.

I've learned to treat each "failed" try as data. Once I started using mistakes instead of judging them, persistence stopped feeling heroic and started feeling practical.

The people who make it aren't the ones with better ideas. They're the ones who survive their first 10 "this won't work" moments.

What changed for me: treating failure as debugging, not defeat. Find what broke, fix it, try again.
