## Original Post

1827+ hours on Claude Code taught me one thing: The workflow matters more than prompts.

Framework:
1. Before you type anything, answer these (task type, research needed, context, what does "done" look like)
2. Build the workflow WITH Claude, not in your head
3. Create docs that live across sessions (task-specific, not just claude.md)
4. Make claude.md a living doc - if correcting twice, it's a rule
5. Remind Claude to refer to docs repeatedly
6. Say "USE THINKING" and "THINK IN STEPS" explicitly
7. If it's not working in 2 turns, stop - go back and annotate

Pattern: Think first -> Structure with Claude -> Docs that persist -> Rules that compound -> Reminders that reinforce -> Approve before execution

    "If you're correcting twice, it's a rule."

    Same principle: if you make a mistake twice, it's a decision.
  strategy: "Amplify-connect - highlight the 'correcting twice = rule' insight, connect to 'mistake twice = decision'"
```

## Notes

- High-value account (74k followers)
- Solid practical advice for Claude Code
- "Correcting twice = rule" connects to our "mistake twice = decision" principle
- Good reference for future Claude best practices content
