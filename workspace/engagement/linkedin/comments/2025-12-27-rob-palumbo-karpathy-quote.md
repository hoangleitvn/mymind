## Original Post

Andrej Karpathy on keeping up with AI: "I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind."

    The list Karpathy names will keep growing. New tools every month.

    What transfers regardless of which tools you use: workflow design and core skills (framing, decomposition, evaluation, correction, systems thinking).

    AI adoption is a workflow decision, not a tool decision.
  strategy: "Add angle - what to focus on, shorter version for reshare"
```
