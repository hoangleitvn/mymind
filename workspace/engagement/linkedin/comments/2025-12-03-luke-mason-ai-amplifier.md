    - AI is a force multiplier, not a replacement
    - Well-managed teams benefit; struggling teams have dysfunction magnified
    - Cannot compensate for poor management or underdeveloped talent
    - Organizations should invest in people first, then use AI

## Original Post

There has been a lot of talk about how Ai is going to replace us all in the near future, but the reality is that most people are still barely using it in the workplace. Here is my take: Ai is often described as a force multiplier, and nowhere will this be more evident than in the way it can interact with human leadership. In skilled, well-managed teams, Ai can streamline workflows, enhance decision-making, and free people to focus on higher-value work. These teams already have the clarity, trust, and communication structures needed to adopt new tools effectively. As a result, Ai will not just make them faster—it will help them become more creative, more precise, and more adaptable. However, Ai cannot compensate for poor management or underdeveloped talent. Many organizations face a genuine skills shortage, especially for highly specialized roles (for example Engineering) where experience, judgment, and professional intuition take years to build. It's tempting to imagine that Ai can fill these gaps, but the reality is that the technology depends on the direction and discernment of capable people. Without that foundation, Ai may generate more output, but it won't generate better outcomes. A team that struggles with fundamentals won't suddenly become high performing because a model is involved. This is why Ai is best understood as an amplifier, not a replacement. It can magnify the strengths of organizations that are already operating at a high level, but it just as easily magnifies dysfunction in teams that lack the skills, leadership, experience and knowledge to understand when it is not providing accurate results, or what it should and should not be used for. Leaders who expect Ai to "solve" capability or performance problems misunderstand both the technology and the nature of human work. Ai can highlight gaps, but it cannot fill them; it can accelerate work, but it cannot raise the baseline competence required to use that acceleration wisely. The path forward for low-performing teams still begins with strengthening human capability: better hiring, clearer expectations, stronger communication, and ongoing skill development. Ai can support these efforts, but it cannot drive them, and it certainly cannot replace them. Organizations that invest in people first—and then use Ai as a force multiplier—will outperform those that treat Ai as a shortcut for building the talent and leadership they lack.

Luke, this is one of the most clear-headed takes on AI I've seen. The amplifier metaphor is exactly right. I see this constantly in business analysis and product management. AI can help you synthesize requirements faster, generate documentation quicker, analyze data more efficiently. But if your team doesn't know how to elicit requirements in the first place, AI just helps you document the wrong thing faster. Teams with strong fundamentals use AI to accelerate what they already do well. Teams without those fundamentals expect AI to teach them basics.

Completely agree. AI is no where close to navigating the complexities of, let's say, a brownfield upgrade of a 30 year old piece of equipment with minimal downtime. Still way too nuanced, requiring creativity and dynamic problem solving. However, I am finding it extremely useful for deep research, thought leadership, and automating low level tasks.

You are presenting it from a rational viewpoint...the issue is the current market isn't rational. All it takes is to look at the white-collar, information-related layoffs in Q4 alone that rationalize the cuts due to AI. All it takes is to talk to the average board member who is pushing their directors to implement AI. The largest companies right now *never* invested in their people first: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google were all notorious for churn and burn across their orgs.

    The harder question is "how do you know if your team is ready?"

    I've worked with 50+ engineering teams and here's a practical test: ask your team to review AI-generated code. If they can't spot the subtle bugs, edge cases, or architectural mismatches within minutes, they're not ready to use AI effectively.

    The skill gap isn't about using AI tools. It's about having enough experience to know when the output looks right but isn't. Junior teams accept plausible-looking code. Senior teams know what "good" looks like and catch the 80% that needs fixing.

    AI makes the gap between capable and struggling teams visible faster. That's actually useful, if leadership is willing to see it.

The programming angle is just where I see it most clearly, but this applies to anyone working with computers.

AI isn't new. It's been evolving for decades. What's different now is the adoption curve. And the real skill isn't knowing every AI tool out there. It's knowing how to structure your workflow around them: how you validate output, when you use which tool, what you never delegate to AI. Build that system first, then you can scale. Adding new models, new capabilities, without starting over each time.

The teams struggling aren't struggling because they picked the wrong tool. They're struggling because they skipped the workflow design step.

The bigger question is what happens when AI reaches people who don't use computers at all. That's when we'll really see if it's an amplifier or a replacement. But until then, the core truth remains: we're humans because we think and do. AI that removes both isn't augmentation. It's something else entirely.

    Hi Luke, thanks for connecting!

    Enjoyed the exchange on your AI amplifier post. Your point about investing in people first resonates with what I see in engineering teams daily.

    Curious about your perspective from the mining and infrastructure side. The "brownfield complexity" that Adam mentioned in the comments feels like it would be everywhere in your world. How are you seeing AI adoption play out in industries where the physical and legacy constraints are so heavy?

    Always interested in how these ideas translate across domains.
