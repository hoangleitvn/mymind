## Original Post

Innovation rarely starts with a big idea. It usually starts with a simple question: why are people doing it this way?

A lot of builders don't stop to ask that. They see a pain point and rush to fix it with a new feature. That kind of thinking feels productive, but it often adds more layers to an already messy system.

I've always preferred to step back and look at how everything fits together. When you start understanding the full workflow, you begin to see the root problems that cause all the smaller ones. That's where meaningful progress comes from.

For years, people accepted LinkedIn as the center of recruiting, and most new tools were built around it. Few stopped to ask whether that model still made sense. We build around what's familiar instead of questioning if the foundation still works.

Real innovation starts when you slow down enough to understand the problem properly, not when you rush to add something new.

Questioning the system itself beats stacking features on top of broken foundations every time.

This is why we say "build 20% that matters."

Most teams add features because they can. Few ask if the foundation still holds. The hardest skill in engineering is knowing when to stop adding and start questioning.

## Notes

- Aligns with foundation-first philosophy
- Good content alignment with engineering leadership positioning
- Low engagement post (5 reactions) - early comment could get visibility
