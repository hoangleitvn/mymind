## Original Post

I'm 34, from Sydney, running my online business, 7 Figure Creators. My wife, who runs a global 8 figure business, gave me the best advice when I started "You've got to get in there and just do everything yourself." I agree with her completely. Our business is 100% bootstrapped from the $180,000 I put into it. Here's exactly what I sell, how I sell it, and the tools I use.

STREET CRED: I've coached 1,750 small business owners who together generate $172 million a year on LinkedIn. We have more than 1,200 testimonials.

AUDIENCE: 100,000 LinkedIn followers, 47,653 email subscribers

WHAT IS SELL: Our 7 Figure Creators program for $897 for 3 months, then $299 a month after that.

WHAT I ACTUALLY SELL: I teach adults how to become confident and talk to humans on LinkedIn to grow their business

MARKETING: I send 3 emails a week. I do 2x live workshops every 3 weeks. I post on LinkedIn 2x day, 7 days a week. My last workshop went for 12 hours and 47 minutes. Oh…our whole team are female salespeople and community managers, and they crush.

HOW I CLOSE: 1) You buy from a Notion doc OR 2) You buy from a Google Doc on a workshop live. You can never book a sales call with me. The only fireable offence in our business is if someone books a time on my calendar.

TOOLS: GrowthMode, the CRM we built for LinkedIn; LinkNinja, the software we built for LinkedIn; Slack, Loom, Zoom. Also Claude, Grok, ChatGPT and Gemini to keep me honest so I don't blow up my own ego.

THE TRUTH: In the first 8 mths, I burned $180k of my own money. 0 idea what I was doing. And I won't lie. I'm still learning daily. It we signed 150 new clients last month and they're getting insane results, so we're going 10x on the 1 price in 2025.

After 3 years of doing this, the main thing I've learned is that you don't learn anything just by reading or watching videos. You learn by doing things. That's it lol.

Crazy how fast things move when you focus on doing the reps instead of overengineering the strategy.

    Your wife's advice is gold. "Do everything yourself first" is exactly how you find the friction points before you scale.

    I ran into the same lesson building my engineering consulting company. First two years, I did everything: sales, delivery, hiring, even the invoices. Painful, but I understood every bottleneck before handing it off.

    The "learning by doing" part hits hard. Reading frameworks is easy. Building the muscle memory to actually execute? That only comes from reps.

    The "no sales calls" policy is counterintuitive and brilliant. Most coaches optimize for conversion rates. You optimized for your time and sanity.

    Curious: did removing sales calls hurt conversion initially, or did the Notion/Google Doc approach convert better than you expected?
  strategy: "Thoughtful Question - Shows genuine curiosity about his unconventional approach"
```

## Notes

- Matt is a high-visibility LinkedIn creator (100K followers)
- His audience overlaps with mine (founders, business owners)
- The "learning by doing" philosophy aligns with my "ugly but working > perfect but invisible" principle
- Good relationship-building target for founder/consultant visibility
