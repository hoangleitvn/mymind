Agreed. Bigger context doesn't mean better results.

The key question: how do we know what is enough?

My approach: train AI to speed up following your workflow. Figure out what needs to be added, what needs to be removed.

Forcing yourself to think about retrieval = forcing yourself to understand your data.

If you don't understand your data, AI won't. And hallucination will come.
    strategy: "Supportive agreement + personal approach - adds practical workflow angle, connects understanding data to hallucination"

## Post Analysis

Shivani (74K followers) makes case for RAG as essential AI skill. Strong technical content with learning roadmap. Key insight: "You can't brute-force context."

## Comment Strategy

Agree with core premise, add the "how do we know what's enough" question, share personal workflow approach, close with hallucination consequence.
