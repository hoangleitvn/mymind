    Same here. Used to context switch while waiting. Tab to email, Slack, LinkedIn, random reading. Then lose 5-10 minutes getting back into the problem.

    Now I'm building a focus mode: stay in the IDE, read the AI's thinking as it works, follow along with its process. When it finishes, I'm already mentally there.

    Context switching always has a cost. Sometimes staying in "active waiting" beats the illusion of multitasking.
  strategy: "Personal Experience - Share authentic experience and current solution being built"
```

## Notes

- Authentic shared experience with proposed solution
- Aligns with "work about work" theme and productivity focus
- Opportunity to discuss developer workflow optimization
