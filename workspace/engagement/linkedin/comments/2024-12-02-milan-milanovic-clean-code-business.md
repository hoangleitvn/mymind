## Original Post

Clean code is too clean to make money

Clean code optimizes for maintainers
Money optimizes for customers

Customers don't pay for elegance
They pay for speed, reliability, and outcomes

Ship a thin slice that solves one painful problem
Measure usage
Fix what breaks
Refactor what earns

Readable code without leverage equals hobby code

Where do you draw the line: "clean enough" or "clean forever"?

Clean code without business impact is useless. But business value without maintainable code is short-lived.

"Refactor what earns" is the key line here.

I've seen teams spend months on architecture that never shipped, and teams with ugly code that captured markets. The difference? Knowing when clean code is an investment vs. a delay.
