## Original Post

Mckinsey just Dropped! AI won't make most human skills obsolete but it will change how we use them. As automation accelerates, the skills that rise in value aren't the most technical… they're the most human. 🧠 Problem-solving 🤝 Negotiation & communication 👥 Leadership & collaboration These become more critical as we work alongside AI agents, copilots, and autonomous systems. Meanwhile, many routine and rules-based tasks will see higher automation exposure. McKinsey's new report, Agents, Robots, and Us, highlights a clear shift: AI isn't replacing most jobs, it's reshaping them. Key takeaways: • 57% of current work hours could technically be automated, but adoption will be gradual. • The biggest impact isn't job loss, it's the rewiring of workflows as humans, AI agents, and robots work together. • Routine digital and information-processing tasks are the most exposed to automation. • Human skills: communication, leadership, problem-solving, coaching, empathy, remain highly resilient and grow in importance. • Companies that redesign roles and workflows (not just tasks) could unlock trillions in value. Only for 48 hours you can sign up to early access the Gen AI Academy https://bit.ly/4pjodAN ✅My take: AI will take over tasks, not take over humans and the skills that make us human will matter more than ever.

AI isn't threatening human skills, it's threatening the illusion that most workflows ever needed to be this complicated. Once the busywork disappears, companies finally see who actually creates value.

This data aligns perfectly with the 'Human Value vs. AI Replacement' graph I just published. I found that while AI acts like a rocket for that ~57% of 'Commoditized Work' (Boilerplate/Syntax), its reliability crashes the moment it crosses into Contextual Novelty. The trap lies in confusing the two. As I found in my recent stress-tests: AI is the king of laying bricks, but it FAILS AS THE ARCHITECT. Replacing Senior Engineers with AI for those architectural tasks isn't building a product; it's building Technical Debt.

AI won't save time unless we change the way the work is done, not just the software we use.

The "redesign workflows, not tasks" distinction is where most teams stumble.

The McKinsey point about human skills resonates. In engineering, the 10x multiplier isn't AI writing code. It's the architect who knows what to build, communicates why it matters, and coordinates across teams. AI amplifies that human judgment. It doesn't replace it.
  strategy: "Expert Insight - Adds practical engineering leadership perspective to workflow vs task distinction. Validates McKinsey's human skills point while grounding it in real team dynamics."
