## Original Post

Joel Chue describes completing a comprehensive frontend and backend application in seven days using AI-assisted development. He breaks down the time savings across five components:

1. **Quiz Logic (40 Questions):** Completed in 30 minutes using Claude instead of the typical two weeks by copywriters
2. **UI/UX Design:** Finalized in 10 minutes with Cursor instead of a week of designer work
3. **Product Generation Logic:** Executed in 15 minutes using Claude versus a full developer week
4. **Backend Setup (Supabase):** Accomplished in 2 hours with guidance from Claude and Gemini troubleshooting
5. **n8n Workflow Orchestration:** Completed in 5 hours instead of typical week-long development

Key Insight: "The job is no longer about writing code; it's about making strategic choices and directing the AI." Positions himself as "Orchestra Conductor, not a laborer."

    This is exactly how AI should be used. Strategic direction, not blind prompting.

    The 30-minute quiz logic vs 2 weeks of copywriting is the real story here. You knew what "done" looked like before you started.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Highlights strategic thinking over speed, reinforces 'knowing what done looks like' as differentiator"
```

## Notes

- Post aligns with "Stop Vibe Coding" theme - Joel succeeded because he understood what he was building
- The "conductor" metaphor is key - works because of existing knowledge
- Potential follow-up: engage if he responds, possible connection target
