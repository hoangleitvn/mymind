The "come with solutions" culture has a hidden cost: people stop surfacing problems early. They wait until they have a solution, which means small issues become big ones.

Worst case: they never raise it because they can't solve it themselves. Then you only hear about problems when they're on fire.

The framework you describe, problem + context + ask, also builds better problem-solvers over time. They learn to think through "what do I need to unblock this" instead of just "how do I fix this alone."
    strategy: "Insightful Addition - Adds hidden cost angle (delayed problem surfacing) and connects to long-term skill building"

## Original Post

Leaders need to stop saying "Don't come with problems, come with solutions". It is such a terrible incomplete mantra. Because the truth is this: Sometimes the person who spotted the problem cannot solve it. Not because they're incompetent — but because they don't have the leverage, context, or authority to move the real blockers. A better standard is this: "Come with problems. Come with context. Come with asks." Tell me: • What you're seeing • Why it matters • What you've tried • And what you need from me to move it That's how high-agency teams actually work. Not by forcing every individual to manufacture a fully-baked solution but by letting the person closest to the problem surface it, and the person with the most leverage unlock it.
