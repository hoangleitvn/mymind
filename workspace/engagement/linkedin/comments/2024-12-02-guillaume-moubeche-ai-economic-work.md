## Original Post

95% of AI agent work won't replace humans. It'll do work humans never did because we couldn't afford to. (And that's the biggest business opportunity)

Pharma Company (Before AI):
- 10 million experimental results
- Scientists review 0.01%
- Rest sits in databases forever
- Potential discoveries? Buried

Pharma Company (With AI):
- AI analyzes all 10 million results
- Finds 17 drug interaction patterns humans missed
- Identifies 3 new compound possibilities
- Saves 5 years of research time

Financial Services (Before AI):
- 100,000 past deals
- Maybe analyze top 50 for patterns
- 99,950 deals = expensive PDF storage

With AI:
- Every deal analyzed for monetization patterns
- Finds: Specific clause combinations worth $10M more
- Optimization nobody could afford to do

Law Firm:
Before: Only take cases worth $100K+ (economics don't work below that)
Now: AI handles all doc review, contract generation, filing
Result: Profitable at $5K cases
Market size: 100x bigger

The revolution isn't AI doing your job. It's AI doing work that was economically impossible.

This is the core misunderstanding about automation generally, we automate things we'd never do manually, not just parts of existing work. GenAI amplifies this even more. Makes productivity gains almost hard to measure. We are comparing against a baseline that never existed.

This IS replacement, actually - just on a 5-year delay. Your pharma scientists reviewing 0.01%? In 5 years, companies will ask: 'Why do we need 50 researchers when AI does the heavy lifting and we need 5 to verify?'

We've been measuring AI productivity wrong. Instead of "AI does 2 developers' work," it's "AI does work nobody could afford to touch."

The ROI calculation changes when the baseline was zero.
