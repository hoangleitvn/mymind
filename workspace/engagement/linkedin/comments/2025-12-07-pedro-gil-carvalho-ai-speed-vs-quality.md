  theme: "AI productivity"
  angle: "Speed vs quality tradeoffs with AI coding"
  key_points:
    - Teams shipping 5-10x faster with AI will outcompete perfectionists
    - Engineers should focus on automating code quality and security reviews
    - Don't be a skeptic or hype beast, be the one with answers

The 5-10x claim will stay debatable. What's less debatable: the teams winning aren't the fastest or the most careful. They're the ones who figured out what to automate.

We've found AI works best on the predictable parts (boilerplate, tests, docs) so humans can focus on the hard parts (architecture decisions, edge cases, user problems).

The real question isn't speed vs quality. It's knowing which parts of your system can tolerate AI-assisted speed and which need human judgment.
    strategy: "Expert Insight - Adds nuance to polarized discussion by reframing from speed-vs-quality to what-to-automate"

## Context

Pedro's post is generating polarized responses. The 5-10x claim is getting pushback (John Crickett's comment has 20 reactions challenging it). The comment section is split between skeptics and believers.

## Opportunity

Add nuanced perspective that:
1. Doesn't dismiss AI productivity gains
2. Doesn't blindly accept hype claims
3. Provides practical framework (what to automate vs what needs humans)
4. Aligns with our "foundation-first" and "build 20% that matters" philosophy
