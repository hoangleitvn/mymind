## Original Post

If AI is helping your engineers move faster inside Jira, PRs, and tickets, you're not seeing the real leverage yet. Those tools exist to coordinate humans. Speeding them up doesn't change the system. The interesting shift happens when AI removes the need for that coordination entirely: No ticket handoff. No manual review loop. No "did anyone remember to...?" That's not an AI feature. That's a system redesign. And it's why AI impact is architectural, not incremental.

    We treat AI like a junior dev: "nice helper" but everything still needs handoffs, approvals and babysitting. Until trust + guardrails change, Jira stays!

    This is the shift most teams miss.

    We've seen it: every hour spent optimizing the handoff process is an hour not spent asking "why do we have handoffs here at all?"

    The real unlock comes when you treat AI as an architecture constraint, not a productivity multiplier. Different design decisions entirely.
  strategy: "Add experience - extend insight from product building perspective"
```

## Notes

- Joe frames AI as architectural change agent, not productivity tool
- Insight: speeding up coordination tools misses the real leverage
- Real shift happens when AI removes coordination need entirely
- Connects to our system-redesign thinking
