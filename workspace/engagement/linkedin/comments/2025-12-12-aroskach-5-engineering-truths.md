## Original Post

I have spent 25 years in software engineering. When I started, I thought the "Best Engineer" was the one who wrote the most complex code. The one who knew every obscure feature of the language. I was completely wrong. Looking back from where I sit now as a Principal Engineer, here are the 5 things I wish I told myself on Day 1:

1. Code is a liability, not an asset. The more code you write, the more you have to debug, maintain, and upgrade. The best senior engineers don't just solve problems with code; they solve them by simplifying the system.

2. Being "Right" is expensive. I used to argue about frameworks and syntax endlessly. I realized later that being easy to work with is a technical skill. If you are brilliant but toxic, you are a bottleneck.

3. Understand the "Why" before the "How". We get paid to solve business problems, not just to move data from A to B. If you don't know why a feature matters to the customer, you cannot build the right architecture for it.

4. Everything is a trade-off. There is no "perfect" architecture. There is only the right architecture for right now. Speed vs. Stability. Scalability vs. Cost. A Senior Engineer knows the answers; a Principal Engineer knows the trade-offs.

5. Detach your ego from your PRs. You are not your code. When someone critiques your logic, they aren't attacking your intelligence. The faster you learn to love code reviews, the faster you grow.

The technology stack changes every 5 years. The principles of good engineering stay the same.

What is one hard truth you learned the hard way?

After 15+ years building teams and products, I keep coming back to this: there is no perfect architecture, only the right one for right now.

Speed vs. stability. Scalability vs. cost. Ship now vs. design for later. The senior engineer knows the answers. The principal engineer knows which question to ask first.
  strategy: "Personal Experience + Supportive Agreement - Validates their trade-off point with own experience, adds spin on the senior vs principal distinction"

## Notes

- Principal Engineer with 25 years experience
- Post aligns strongly with our architecture and trade-off thinking
- Point #4 directly matches our key saying about architecture
- Good engagement for engineering leadership positioning
