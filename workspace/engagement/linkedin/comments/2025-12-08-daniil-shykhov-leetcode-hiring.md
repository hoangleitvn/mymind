The debugging and clear communication you describe are the real filters. Those are hard to fake in a real-world task.

Algorithm tests are easy to administer at scale. That's why big tech uses them. For smaller teams where every hire matters, the overhead of real-world evaluation pays off.

To be honest, if I was in an interview about LeetCode, I might fail too.

Exactly. LeetCode measures algorithm complexity and execution time. Clear winner, clear loser.

Real-world problems have multiple valid solutions. The skill isn't finding the "best" one. It's knowing the tradeoffs and picking the most suitable approach based on your stage, constraints, and context.

That judgment doesn't show up in a 45-minute coding test.

## Original Post

I hired an engineer who couldn't invert a binary tree. Best hire I ever made. He hadn't done LeetCode in years. Said, "Honestly, I'd Google it." Most companies would've passed. I almost did too. So I gave him a real-world task. And he nailed it. He didn't guess: - He could debug like a detective. - He asked smart questions. - He explained his thinking clearly, even when under pressure. Six months in, he was leading projects. Making everyone around him better. Don't get me wrong: Algorithm questions are great - they test logical thinking under pressure. But they're just one lens. Big tech can afford to lose 20% of great candidates if they filter out 80% of poor ones. But when each hire is critical to your team's success, maybe we need a different filter. I'd rather hire someone who knows how to think, than someone who just remembers how to answer.
