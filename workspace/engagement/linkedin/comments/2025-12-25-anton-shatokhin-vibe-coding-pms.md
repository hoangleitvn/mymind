  key_points:
    - PRD workflow had too many iterations and questions
    - Prototype gets instant "Got it, let's build"
    - Documentation now for edge cases, data flows, AI agent behavior
    - PMs who prototype speak engineering language

## Original Post

I stopped showing documentation to developers. Sounds crazy? Hear me out. The old way: Hours on PRD -> 20 questions -> still not quite right -> iterations -> more calls -> finally done. The new way: Vibe-coded a prototype -> showed it -> "Got it, let's build." That's it. -> Fewer meetings -> Fewer misunderstandings -> Faster to production My stack: Claude Code - for local prototypes (or when security policies don't allow cloud tools) Lovable - when you need to share without deployment headaches Documentation isn't dead. But it's no longer about "what it looks like." Now it's about edge cases, data flows, and AI agent behavior. For everything else? A prototype beats a doc. Every time. Here's my hot take: Vibe coding for PMs is becoming non-negotiable. Like Excel in 2010. Like Figma in 2020. The PMs who prototype speak the language of engineering. And that's a different level of influence. Are you already vibe coding or still on the fence? #productmanagement #vibecoding #AI #futureofwork

    Why don't go the whole way and finish the job as a PM? Why do you need developers then?

    Moving from static PRDs to interactive prototypes definitely bridges the communication gap, but how are you handling the documentation of those "un-vibeable" edge cases and logic constraints?

    Totally agree with the vibe: a quick prototype kills most misunderstandings. But there's a real risk - you can easily miss edge cases and weird failure paths.

    Agreed, and this is what we have been doing now for our projects. The prototype is WHAT the system should do. The developer adds WHO - system identity, architecture fit, patterns.

    PRDs were always about HOW (step-by-step specs). Prototypes show WHAT (behavior). Engineers figure out how it fits their system.

    That's why vibe coding works for PMs: it's context, not instructions. Different skill than actually building.

    Curious: what's been the hardest part of making this shift with your team?
  strategy: "Add experience - WHAT vs WHO framework, answer Vaidas's 'why need developers' question"
```

## Notes

- Vibe coding for PMs: prototype > documentation
- PRDs = HOW, Prototypes = WHAT, Engineers add WHO (system identity)
- Vaidas's question is the key tension: where does PM prototyping end and developer work begin?
- Our angle: PMs provide context (WHAT), developers provide system fit (WHO)
