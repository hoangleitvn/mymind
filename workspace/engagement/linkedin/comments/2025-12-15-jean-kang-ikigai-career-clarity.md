## Post Analysis

Jean Kang (263K followers) shares a clear 3-step Ikigai framework for career clarity. The post uses visual formatting (emojis, structure) and credits the original source. 903 reactions indicates strong resonance.

Most comments are supportive agreement. Bill Achola's "direction, not destination" comment adds genuine nuance.

## Comment Strategy

**Approach:** Personal experience with an insightful addition

**Why:** The existing comments are mostly agreement. Adding the evolution angle (Ikigai changes as you grow) provides substance without disagreeing with the core message. Connects to my founder journey from engineer to tech leader.

**Voice check:**
- No generic praise
- Specific personal experience
- Adds nuance to the framework
- Short, direct sentences
