  content: |
    Already building this. We're developing skills and plugins for Claude Code right now - content workflows, engagement tracking, context management.

    The "middleware" framing is right. The models give you capability. Skills give you repeatability. Someone still needs to wire them to your actual work.

    That's where the value is.
  strategy: "Personal Experience - Show we're actively building in this space. Validates his middleware insight. Positions as builder, not just observer."
```

## Notes

- Directly relevant to Mizemind (we're building skills/plugins)
- Shows we're active in this space
- Good visibility in AI/Claude conversation
- Smaller account but relevant topic
