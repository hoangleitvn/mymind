## Original Post

Writing code is no longer a scarce skill. For the last 20 years, being able to write code has been the hard part of software engineering. If you could do that, you were valuable. That changed fast. LLMs made code generation abundant. It is not perfect, but writing code is no longer the main bottleneck. Engineering did not disappear. It moved up a level, and it matters more than ever. What is scarce now is the ability to define intent. System boundaries. What belongs inside the system and what does not. What must always be true. How data flows. How errors are handled. These decisions define what a system is actually supposed to guarantee. A lot of the backlash against vibe coding comes from missing this shift. The work did not get smaller. It became more abstract. If your sense of value comes only from writing lines of code, this shift can feel uncomfortable. But leverage today comes from guiding, shaping, and validating what systems produce. That is where real leverage is moving. Curious how you see this evolving over the next few years.

    This matches what I see working with teams on AI adoption. The gap is widening fast.

    The engineers who already thought in systems (boundaries, invariants, data contracts) are thriving. They use AI as a force multiplier. The ones who optimized for writing more code are struggling to adapt.

    Here's the uncomfortable part: most teams aren't training for this shift. They're buying AI tools and expecting the same engineers to suddenly become architects.

    That gap won't close by itself.
  strategy: "Insightful Addition - validates observation with real experience, adds practical concern about training gap"
```
