## Original Post

Most underperformers on your team are not found. They are created.

Taha introduces "The Golem Effect" - a psychological phenomenon where low expectations become self-fulfilling prophecies.

**The mechanism of underperformance creation:**
- Leaders quietly decide someone isn't ready
- They assign smaller problems with reduced context
- Feedback becomes softer and less constructive
- This pattern reinforces limited performance

**Four places this manifests on engineering teams:**

1. **Climate** - Who receives patience and attention?
2. **Input** - Who gets full context versus just tickets?
3. **Output** - Who handles high-visibility, challenging work?
4. **Feedback** - Who receives specific, growth-oriented critiques?

**Central insight:** "If the same person keeps landing on the 'less' side of those questions, you are not just measuring performance. You are designing it."

Taha reflects on applying this pattern at Yahoo with an engineer, acknowledging he disliked the outcome and later changed his approach.

**Call to Action:** Leaders should examine the "room" they've built for each team member and ensure it aligns with their values.
