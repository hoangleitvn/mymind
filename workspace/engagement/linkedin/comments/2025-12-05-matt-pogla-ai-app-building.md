## Original Post

How I Build Apps In Minutes With AI

Most people use AI to write code. They don't know AI can now run the app and fix bugs too. Automatically.

Key Platform Features (Anything):
- Auto-generates frontend and backend
- Automated database, authentication, and payment configuration
- AI-designed UI with included hosting
- Production-ready deployment from day one

12-Step Build Process: Users write prompts in plain English, optionally add reference images, select AI models, and generate apps without coding or configuration.

Growth Metrics:
- 700,000+ registered users
- $2 million ARR in first two weeks
- 20,000 new projects daily

    The real shift here isn't automation...it's accessibility. When full-stack development happens from a prompt, the barrier to building a business basically disappears.

    Does that include error boundaries and loading states or just the happy path?

    The accessibility point is real. Lower barriers mean more people building, more experiments, faster validation.

    The question Paolo raised matters though: happy path vs production-ready are different games. Error states, edge cases, scaling issues. That's where debugging skills still matter.

    For MVPs and validation? This changes the game. For products with real users depending on them? The "fix bugs automatically" part needs human judgment on what's actually broken.

    Build fast, but know what you're shipping.
  strategy: "Expert Insight - Acknowledge the value while adding nuance about production-readiness vs demos. Amplifies Paolo's critical question."
```

## Notes

- Post is promotional for "Anything" platform but raises legitimate points about AI accessibility
- Growth metrics are impressive if accurate (700K users, $2M ARR)
- Paolo's question about error boundaries vs happy path is the critical nuance
- Aligns with my "AI bubble vs snowball" theme - fast building is good, but validation matters
- Not dismissive of the tool, but adds perspective from someone who builds production systems
