## Original Post

Jason Moccia (14.4K followers): "What you anchor yourself to makes all the difference."

Don't confuse the vehicle with the destination. Your current role or company is just the vessel you're using right now to make an impact.

Anchoring to people, projects, or companies is unstable - these are temporary. When identity is tied to a calling, obstacles become navigation challenges rather than threats.

"Be loyal to the mission. Everything else should be negotiable."

    "Loyal to the mission, everything else negotiable" - that's the filter.

    As a founder: loyal to building things that last. The product form, the team structure, the market approach - all negotiable. The mission isn't.

    Vehicles change. Destinations don't have to.
  strategy: "Founder perspective - connects to 'builds that last' brand, echoes his vehicle/destination metaphor"
```
