The iteration loop is the real experience. One shot, realize it's incomplete, another prompt, hit edge case, more prompts, context window fills up, AI starts forgetting what you told it 10 prompts ago, quality drops, restart from scratch.

Then multiply that by the complexity of real production code.

The "I built this in one prompt" demos skip this part. They show the highlight reel, not the hours of back-and-forth getting it production-ready.

Your framing is right: we're discovering how to build software with AI through... building software with AI. Empirically.

Iteration. Experimentation and discovery. That is how we do things successfully.

One-shot folks are setting up intentional or unintentional false expectations.

Not at all helpful.

Exactly. The "one-shot and wait" crowd never has those aha moments. They don't learn much about engineering because they're watching outputs, not building understanding.

The real learning happens in the iteration loop: prompt, fail, adjust, repeat. That's where you internalize how the system actually works. That is how we build mental modals.

## Original Post

The One-Shot Fallacy "I built this app in one prompt." Impressive demo. Misleading lesson. One-shot treats AI like a magic genie. Describe what you want perfectly, get exactly what you need. But AI can generate code that works without grasping the why behind a complex business problem. That why isn't discovered in prompts. It's discovered in iteration. Software development is an empirical process. You learn what users actually need by building something, watching it fail, and building again. Requirements emerge through the work, not before it. One-shot assumes perfect knowledge upfront — that you won't discover anything along the way. It's waterfall wearing a hoodie. Even Andrej Karpathy — the godfather of vibe coding — recently hand-coded his latest project because AI agents "just didn't work well enough." If he doesn't trust one-shot for serious work, why would you? The people most impressed by one-shot demos? Often folks who haven't been rousted out of bed at 0300 on a Sunday morning due to a production outage. Some lessons are only learned via bitter experience. Vibe coding and AI-augmented development shine at empirical discovery — precisely because they let you iterate faster. They let you learn faster. Everything we know about building great software was discovered through empirical, iterative processes. None of it was handed down on tablets from on high. What we're living through right now is arguably the biggest revolution in software development since we started doing it. Which means we're going to have to iteratively learn what works, what doesn't, and how to fit the pieces together. We aren't just building software with vibe coding and AI-augmented development. We're creating a whole new way of building software. And that requires the same empirical discipline we've always needed — just applied to the craft itself. Vibe to explore. Engineer to ship. Learn as you go.

## Notes

- Follow-up post to his earlier "To Vibe or Not" post
- Continues his framing: "Vibe to explore. Engineer to ship."
- Good opportunity to add the context window angle from real practitioner experience
- Jordan has been responsive to our previous comments on this topic
