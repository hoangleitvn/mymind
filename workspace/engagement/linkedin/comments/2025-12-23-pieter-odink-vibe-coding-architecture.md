## Original Post

When vibe-coding, I wrongly assumed the AI Coding Agents would automatically create a neat codebase as well. They don't; they just solve my feature requests as a one-off. With every request, the time I was spending on QA increased. Up to the point that there was no progress at all anymore. So I asked the AI Agent to create the architecture for my codebase. But it's not designed for that job. The AI Agent retrofitted a narrative on top of the existing code base. Which is different from what was needed: explicit simple, intentional rules that reflect how the product works. They act as guardrails for the individual vibes. I have to own and protect that system of rules, for the codebase to make sense.

    My experience is that the human needs to drive the architecture and let the AI fill in the gaps one by one. Otherwise, the bigger the scope the lower the quality of what AI produces

    This is the gap most people miss with AI coding.

    AI is an executor, not an architect. It solves the immediate request without understanding how pieces fit together. The system of rules has to exist first, and you have to own it.

    I've found the same pattern: markdown files with explicit guardrails work better than hoping the AI "figures it out." The AI interprets specs. It doesn't create them.

    Once you own the architecture, the AI becomes 10x more useful.
  strategy: "Expert Insight + Personal Experience - Validates his realization, connects to markdown guardrails approach, reinforces architect mindset"
```

## Notes

- Strong alignment with your architect mindset and vibe coding critique
- His learning journey matches your published content on this topic
- Early post (1h old) - good opportunity for visibility
- Giorgio's comment reinforces the point - good thread for your perspective
