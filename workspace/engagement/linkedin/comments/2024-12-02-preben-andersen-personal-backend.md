## Original Post

What will separate the top performers in the future?

AI companies today are competing on context and so should you.

A lot seem to point towards top performers having their own personal backend.

A toolkit they bring with them wherever they go.

We are already seeing a lightweight version of this today.

To get the most out of my agents (like Cursor, Claude and Comet) I maintain and update context, rules and prompts that make me more effective.

This will expand to be about build agents that will automate bigger parts of our job in the background.

Then we will need to manage a suite of agents.

This stack becomes an extension of you and it gets sharper on every update/iteration.

Capabilities and efficiencies compound.

Maybe this personal backend is what future employees are evaluated on?

Request for startups: Make it easy for employees to manage their personal backend.

Your 'personal backend' will be the new CV. Not just what you did, but what you built to do it better.

Building this right now. Skills, context files, and custom prompts that load automatically based on task type.

The compounding effect is real. Every iteration makes the next task faster. The gap between "uses AI" and "has a personal AI stack" will only widen.
  strategy: "Personal Experience - Directly relevant to current work, validates thesis with real implementation, reinforces compounding insight."

have you seen any software out that's that can be your personal backend? Doppler and Raycast could be it, but it's limited as of now

Haven't looked at Doppler or Raycast for this yet, or external memory layers. Still defining my workflow.

What I'm building is more manual: CLAUDE.md files for project context + custom skills that load per task type + structured prompts. Has issues sometimes, but it works and the pieces compound.

Curious what's missing in Raycast/Doppler for you?

I would like an agent that continuously updates the context surrounding my company; what we are building, who we are contacting, our pitch decks. Everything. This way I could use any AI Product Cursor, Wepost or Canva without having to manually feed in updates.

That's the dream - a unified context layer that syncs everywhere.

Right now the friction is real: update your pitch deck, manually feed it to three different tools, hope they remember what you told them last week.

The hard part is "continuously updates." Static context is solvable. Living context that tracks changes as you work - that's where it gets interesting.

Would you want it to infer updates automatically or approve before syncing?
