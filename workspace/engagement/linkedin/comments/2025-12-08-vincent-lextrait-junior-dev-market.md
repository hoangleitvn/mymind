  theme: "Engineering careers - junior dev market struggles"
  angle: "Contrarian take: junior struggles not caused by AI, but by lack of fundamentals"
  key_points:
    - Junior dev job market struggles are NOT caused by AI
    - If AI were the cause, juniors (AI natives) would be favored
    - Juniors buy into "X replaces Y" propaganda, don't learn fundamentals
    - Many jobs exist (6K at Google alone) but juniors can't/won't apply
    - Pattern repeats each generation AI/JS, JS/Java, Java/C++
    - Advice to juniors put in hard work, don't listen to propaganda

## Original Post

Vincent Lextrait's contrarian take on junior developer job market struggles. His argument: it's not AI killing junior jobs, it's juniors buying into "X replaces Y" propaganda and not learning fundamentals. Claims lots of jobs exist but juniors can't/won't apply.

Comments show significant pushback from actual juniors and job seekers saying the market is genuinely hard, not just a skills gap.

    This needs to be said more.

    AI won't replace developers who understand fundamentals. It will replace developers who only know how to use the latest tool without understanding why it works.

    Juniors: be curious. Learn what matters, not what's trending. The ones who put in the hard work now will be the seniors others depend on later.

    The shortcut mindset is the trap.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Amplifies his motivational message to juniors. Adds AI angle: AI replaces tool-chasers, not fundamentals-builders. Encouragement over doom."
```
