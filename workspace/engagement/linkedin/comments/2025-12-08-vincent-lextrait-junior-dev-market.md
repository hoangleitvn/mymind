    - Junior dev job market struggles are NOT caused by AI
    - If AI were the cause, juniors (AI natives) would be favored

    - Many jobs exist (6K at Google alone) but juniors can't/won't apply
    - Pattern repeats each generation: AI/JS, JS/Java, Java/C++
    - Advice to juniors: put in hard work, don't listen to propaganda

This needs to be said more.

AI won't replace developers who understand fundamentals. It will replace developers who only know how to use the latest tool without understanding why it works.

Juniors: be curious. Learn what matters, not what's trending. The ones who put in the hard work now will be the seniors others depend on later.

The shortcut mindset is the trap.
    strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Amplifies his motivational message to juniors. Adds AI angle: AI replaces tool-chasers, not fundamentals-builders. Encouragement over doom."
