## Original Post

Claude Code just shipped a feature that changes how I think about AI coding assistants. It's called Insight. And it's deceptively simple. When Claude makes a mistake or figures something out during your session, it writes that down. Local knowledge. Next time, will it hit the same problem? It doesn't repeat the error. It learns. I've been using it for two days. The difference is noticeable. Here's a real example from my Dingo compiler work. Claude kept generating the wrong pattern matching syntax for Go enums — using type switches when my tests expected tag-based matching. Classic AI loop: make mistake, get corrected, make same mistake again. With Insight? It captured the pattern. That knowledge persists. No more correcting the same thing five times in one session. This is what I've wanted from AI coding tools — not just raw capability, but the ability to get better as we work together. To accumulate context. To stop being a goldfish.

    The goldfish problem is real. Been there with the same correction loop, especially on project-specific patterns.

    Interesting that it captured the type-switch vs tag-based distinction. That's exactly the kind of local context that gets lost between sessions.

    Will check this out.

## Notes

- New Claude Code feature worth checking out
- Relevant to AI development workflow
- Good product insight about session-level learning
