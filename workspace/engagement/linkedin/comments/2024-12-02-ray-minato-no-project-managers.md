## Original Post

We don't have project managers.
On purpose.

Every one of our Development Leads runs their project like they're a CTO.
Because they are.

Most dev shops have three people managing what one person should own:
• Technical Lead (makes the tech decisions)
• Project Manager (tracks the timeline)
• Client Success Manager (handles the relationship)

Three salaries. Three perspectives. Six possible conversation paths - each person seeing one-third of the picture - and naturally optimize their own slice - but not always the best for the big picture.

Know why everyone does it this way?

Because finding someone who can do all three is brutally hard.

You need someone who can zoom into memory allocation bugs, then zoom out to market strategy. Someone with the technical chops to architect a system, the empathy to navigate client fears, and the business sense to protect margins.

Someone who tells hard truths early instead of soft truths too late.

Most technical people? They want to stay in the code.
Most client-facing people? They can't speak engineering.
Most project managers? They manage tasks, not outcomes.

Finding someone who can switch between debugging firmware and discussing ROI with a CEO in the same morning? One in a thousand.

Training them to think this way? Not easy. Uncomfortable for all. But for those who really want it - worth every second & penny.

But here's what happens when you find them - or better, when you develop them:

They see the whole system. Not the tasks. Not the timeline. The system.
They make trade-offs a PM would never understand.
They spot risks a technical lead would miss.
They connect the dots to produce true innovation.
They prevent fires instead of managing them.

When one person owns the full stack - from client pain to code deployment to P&L - there's nowhere to hide. No one else to blame. No excuses. Just pure accountability, true autonomy, true ownership.

Has this model limited our growth? Absolutely.

My strategy mentor-from-afar Alex M H Smith calls this "strategic commitment" and says: "when you sacrifice something your competitors care about, it opens up unseen possibilities".

We've sacrificed scale for excellence. Customer happiness has been north of 80 NPS for 6 years.

The harsh reality:

You split ownership, you split execution.

Most companies design their org chart for control, not outcomes. So they get exactly what they designed for: gaps, handoffs, finger-pointing. "That's not my job." Everyone protecting their piece instead of building the whole.

Most companies won't do this because it's easier to hire three average people than to find one exceptional one.

We'd rather have the exceptional ones.

Project Managers manage projects.
Our Development Leads manage outcomes.

And that difference is everything.

Sounds very much like an early startup founder role. Multiple hats, interdisciplinary thinking, total accountability.

Same at INNOMIZE. Some projects we run without PM - team owns the outcome and full execution. When we do have PM, they're enablers, not gatekeepers.

This works especially well for early startups and small teams. PM becomes more valuable when you have multiple teams needing alignment and constant timeline coordination.
  strategy: "Personal Experience - Shares INNOMIZE experience directly, adds nuance about when PM makes sense (scaling/alignment), positions PM as enabler not controller."

## Notes

- HIGHLY aligned with embedded CTO / accountability model
- Good follow target - similar philosophy on ownership
- Could be potential collaborator or industry connection
- Low engagement (21 reactions) - early comment gets visibility
