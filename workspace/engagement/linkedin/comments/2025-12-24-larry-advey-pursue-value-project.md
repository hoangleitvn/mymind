## Original Post

Best advice I received from a mentor: If you believe a project has value, pursue it until someone tells you absolutely to stop. In the days before observability, people like me would monitor hundreds of database servers to understand who was doing what, where, and when. Besides being a strenuous manual process, this became especially problematic when servers would go offline to get patched. There was no easy way to notify people when their servers were scheduled to go offline, which caused all kinds of negative ripple effects. When people came to me asking why their servers were offline, the best we could tell them was, "Go check this very large spreadsheet where the schedule for all servers lives." When I said "very large," what I really meant was, "large enough that perusing it manually will drive you insane." I knew the solution would be a lot of work, work that wasn't directly tied to my core responsibilities, and that my boss wasn't specifically asking for. But I also knew: 1. How to fix it (bring in some other metadata, write some SQL script to send alerts) 2. The value of fixing the issue (saving a ton of time, boosting morale) 3. The stakeholders who would benefit from the fix 4. How to quantify the value to me and other stakeholders It wasn't simple work. I devoted both working hours and non-working hours to developing and implementing it. When I was done, I named the solution "Hermes," after the Greek messenger god, as it turned an abyss of disorganized data into a streamlined communication system. As I expected, it saved us all a ton of time and stress. If you believe strongly in a project, pursue it. Don't do it at the expense of your core responsibilities, and don't do it in a way that damages the organization. I wouldn't have built Hermes if a mentor hadn't given me that advice.

    The flip side of "first time mistake, second time decision."

    Someone wrote today: once you're aware, repeating the same pattern is a choice. Your mentor's advice is the inverse. Once you see the value, NOT pursuing it is also a choice.

    Both require the same thing: awareness creates responsibility. For what you keep doing wrong. And for what you don't start doing right.

    You had all four pieces: how to fix it, the value, the stakeholders, the metrics. That clarity turned it from "extra work" into an obvious decision.
  strategy: "Add angle - connect to Lindsay Linhart's post about mistake vs decision, frame as inverse pattern"
```
