    content: "most probably because there are more empowering utility on Cursor or similar. It's an ide like others made specifically for augmented development... Not just an extension. Hence even if you use Claude Code there are other features you can benefit from Cursor/Windsurf/Antigravity and so on."

Valid point. The IDE shell matters for workflow ergonomics. For me, the terminal-first approach of Claude Code fits how I think about tasks - but I can see how visual diff tools and sidebar chat would be valuable for others.

I keep reading "switch to Cursor" posts but haven't found a compelling reason to leave VS Code yet. Tool switching has real costs - even switching between terminal and UI can disrupt your mental model.

Curious which specific Cursor features you find most valuable when pairing with Claude Code?

Makes sense. When Claude Code is doing the heavy lifting, the IDE becomes more about viewing and reviewing than editing.
