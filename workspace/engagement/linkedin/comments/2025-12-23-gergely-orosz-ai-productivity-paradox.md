## Original Post

Gergely Orosz observes the AI productivity paradox: at AI startups with unlimited AI budgets, developers work MORE hours, not fewer. The reason is competition - if everyone has the same tools, the bar rises. AI doesn't reduce work; it raises expectations.

    The Red Queen effect in action. Run faster to stay in place.

    We see this constantly. AI saves time. That time immediately gets filled with more scope. Nobody leaves early.

    Has anyone actually managed to convert AI gains into fewer hours instead of more output?
  strategy: "Personal Experience + Question CTA - validates his observation with direct experience, names the pattern (Red Queen effect), ends with engaging question"
