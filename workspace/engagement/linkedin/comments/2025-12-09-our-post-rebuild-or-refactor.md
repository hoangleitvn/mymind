    10+ years of consulting. Around 10 products we built never went live. Or lived one month then shut down.

    Not one failed because of the tech.

    Every single one failed because validation came too late. Or PMF never arrived.

    The irony? If they'd succeeded, we'd have gotten more work. But watching "perfect" codebases die taught us more than any successful project.

    Now we push clients to validate before we write a single line of production code.
  strategy: "Personal Experience - Adding consulting experience to reinforce the post's message about stage-appropriate engineering decisions."
```

## Notes

- Self-comment to add personal consulting experience
- Provides concrete evidence (10 failed products) supporting core argument
- Rebuild vs refactor decision depends on stage, not code quality
