## Original Post

The moment you know better, it stops being a mistake. First time? Mistake. Learning. Second time? Decision. Awareness. Once you see how it ends, repeating it is a choice. Not a bad day. Not a slip. A choice. Some people keep "making mistakes" for years. But what's really happening? They're choosing comfort. They're choosing fear. They're calling it indecision. Growth isn't just about doing more right. It's about refusing to make the same wrong choice twice.

    This reframe applies to technical decisions too.

    First time you skip the foundation to ship faster - that's learning. Second time, you have the data. You know what breaks. Choosing the same shortcut isn't a mistake anymore.

    I've seen teams repeat the same "emergency" shortcuts for months. They had the evidence. They just preferred familiar chaos over the discomfort of changing.

    Your question is the cut: Is this still a mistake, or a decision I'm making?
  strategy: "Add experience - extend personal growth insight to engineering/technical decision-making"
```

## Notes

- First time is a mistake (learning), second time is a decision (awareness + responsibility)
- Awareness transforms accidents into choices
- Comfort and fear disguise as indecision
- Extended insight to engineering context in our comment
