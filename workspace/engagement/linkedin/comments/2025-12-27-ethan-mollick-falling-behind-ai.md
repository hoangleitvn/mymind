## Original Post

So yes, you are falling behind, but so is everyone else. I can guarantee you that nobody at all is keeping up with all the implications of AI and its major uses, even the people who are relatively up-to-date on the latest AI models themselves. Everyone is figuring it out as they go, even Andraj.

    This is why chasing every new tool is a losing game.

    The list keeps growing. The models keep changing. The "best practices" are outdated by the time you learn them.

    What compounds: workflow design and the 5 skills that work regardless of which tools you use: Framing, decomposition, evaluation, correction, systems thinking.

    Tools change monthly. Those skills transfer.
  strategy: "Add angle - what to focus on when you can't track everything"

## Notes

- Ethan Mollick is Professor at Wharton, Author of Co-Intelligence (352K followers)
- This is his response to Karpathy's viral "skill issue" post
- We engaged on Karpathy's post earlier with "workflow and skills first, tools second" angle
- This comment extends that framing
