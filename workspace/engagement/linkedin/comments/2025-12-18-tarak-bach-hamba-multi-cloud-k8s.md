  key_points:
    - Dual reference architecture (AKS + EKS) with clear service mapping
    - Private-by-default networking, no public API endpoints
    - Enterprise security from day 1 (encryption, least-privilege IAM, hardened registries)
    - IaC with Terraform and CloudFormation, modular and repeatable
    - Validation and hardening baked in

    content: "Tarak, it's a gift of a post. Thanks for that! What I appreciate here is the discipline around true equivalence: private control planes, IAM parity, and service mapping are often where multi-cloud designs quietly drift. How do you decide where strict symmetry is worth the effort versus allowing intentional divergence as Azure and AWS features evolve?"

    content: "Most 'multi-cloud' posts stop at diagrams. This one actually maps the services and controls end-to-end (ACR ↔ ECR, Key Vault ↔ Secrets Manager/SSM, Log Analytics ↔ CloudWatch) with private control planes on both sides. That's the kind of baseline that survives security review and day-2 ops."

    content: "This is solid work, especially the deliberate choice to treat AKS as the reference baseline while implementing EKS as a true first-class equivalent, not a 'best-effort' port. The service parity mapping (identity, registry, secrets, logging) and private-by-default control planes are where most multi-cloud initiatives quietly fail."

That is a comprehensive and solid architecture for enterprise, especially focus on government with landing zone, secured by default, shift left security mindset. Curious: the diagram is generated by infracodebase?

Tarak explained: diagrams generated from workspace (cloud accounts, Terraform/Bicep, modules, policies). Same context surfaces threat vectors, trust boundaries, control-plane isolation. Diagrams stay aligned with code. Asked: "When you review architectures today, do you usually trust the diagram, or do you end up reverse-engineering reality from the code and cloud console anyway?"

Both. Diagram-first forces engineers to follow, but it is often obsolete. And especially with AI, we also should have a task to design the architecture first, once the architecture is confirmed, then the agents do their job to write IaC. Autonomous creating IaC, generating diagrams and architecture documents also fine. But I would rather catch the design earlier and add missing pieces. That is how we work as humans; AI just speeds up. This is how I think.

Reviewing code and compere is also challenging. That is why AWS built tools like AWS Perspective or AWS Workload Discovery for that purpose.

I design in layers.

Start with the logical architecture: what capabilities do we need? Compute, storage, networking, identity, observability. At this level, it's cloud-agnostic.

Before drilling down, look at design constraints and principles. Cost, compliance, team expertise, performance requirements, existing investments. These guide the selection.

Then the physical layer: which cloud, which services, which configurations. ACR vs ECR, Key Vault vs Secrets Manager. The architecture intent is already validated before we get here.

Vendor-agnostic is good to evaluate, but not always practical. Sometimes the cloud-specific tool is just better for the job. I still use AWS Perspective and Workload Discovery for visualizing and generating diagrams. They solve real problems.

Honestly, still exploring how to manage this better. No perfect answer yet.

Yes, the diagram is generated by Infracodebase. The idea isn't just "pretty diagrams", but diagrams as a by-product of real infrastructure context.

In practice:
• I generate architecture diagrams directly from the workspace (cloud accounts, Terraform/Bicep, modules, policies)
• The same context is used to surface threat vectors, trust boundaries, and control-plane isolation
• Diagrams stay aligned with the code and evolve as the infra evolves (no stale slides)

So instead of drawing first and implementing later, the diagram reflects:
• what's actually deployed
• how AWS/Azure services map 1:1
• where security and blast radius really live

When you review architectures today, do you usually trust the diagram, or do you end up reverse-engineering reality from the code and cloud console anyway?

That makes sense, and I mostly agree with you. Diagram-first is useful to force intent and discussion, but if it doesn't stay tied to reality it becomes shelfware very fast. That's where I see the real value in generating diagrams from the same context as the infra and IaC, so design and implementation don't drift apart.

Tbh, when it comes to reviewing code quality and code security, I still rely on my AppSec instincts for that. And on the cloud side, CSPM-style reasoning helps a lot to understand exposure and blast radius.

I know the AWS tools you mentioned (Perspective, Workload Discovery), but I'm personally not a fan of the lock-in. I think teams need to stay flexible enough to manage infra based on technical and business constraints, not the boundaries of a single cloud's tooling.

How do you balance early design validation vs avoiding over-committing to a specific cloud's way of modeling reality?

# Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Platform (AKS + EKS)

## Post Summary

Tarak shared a comprehensive guide on building production-ready multi-cloud Kubernetes platform extending from a private AKS Landing Zone to include EKS. Key focus: security-first, private-by-default, with IaC that actually runs.

## Key Insights from Conversation

1. **Infracodebase generates diagrams from real infrastructure context** - not drawing first, but reflecting what's deployed
2. **Diagram-first vs code-first debate** - both approaches have value, but diagrams drift without automation
3. **AI in architecture workflow** - design first, then agents write IaC; humans catch design gaps early
4. **Tool lock-in concern** - Tarak prefers flexibility over single-cloud tooling (AWS Perspective, Workload Discovery)
5. **CSPM-style reasoning** - useful for understanding exposure and blast radius
