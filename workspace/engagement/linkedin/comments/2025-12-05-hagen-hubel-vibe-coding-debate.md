  theme: "Vibe coding debate - Gen X vs Gen Z"
  angle: "Speed vs fundamentals in modern development"
  key_points:
    - Gen-X is tech-first, architecture matters
    - Gen-Z is product-first, ship fast iterate
    - Speed wins more often in 2025
    - Most startups die from lack of traction not tech debt
    - Best teams have both speed AND fundamentals

## Original Post

My Hot Take: The "Vibe Coding" Debate is Missing the Point Gen-X engineers: "Gen-Z can't code without AI. No fundamentals." Gen-Z engineers: "We shipped 3 products while you were refactoring." Both are right. Both are wrong. The data: - Gen-Z founders are hitting unicorn status at record speed - But ask them to debug a memory leak without Claude? 😬 Here's what's actually happening: Gen-X = Tech-first thinking -> Build it right, scale now/later?, architecture matters Gen-Z = Product-first thinking: -> Ship fast, iterate, let AI handle the boring stuff The old way: spend 6 months perfecting your architecture The new way: ship an MVP in 2 weeks, let paying customers tell you what to fix Neither approach is wrong. But in 2025, speed wins more often than perfect code. And the uncomfortable truth: most startups die from lack of traction, not technical debt. Who are the companies crushing it right now? They have Gen-Z speed AND Gen-X fundamentals at the table. What's your take? Are we sacrificing too much at the altar of velocity?

Quote: "The new way: ship an MVP in 2 weeks, let paying customers tell you what to fix" … If that's really your philosophy, I'm not sure how anyone is supposed to take you seriously. Shipping fast is great - pretending that customer feedback magically replaces engineering reality isn't.

As always, this is not a matter of black and white. On the long run, you need both: quick prototyping and in-depth understanding of the code. To achieve both, you need a mixed team, preferring both approaches, courage and respect.

Vibe coding is great for MVPs and prototypes, but it breaks apart completely when you hit production at even moderate scale. Can you name even one unicorn, or even a successful company, that only relies on vibe coding?

Gen Y here, but architecture-focused. So I've seen both sides.

Speed wins, agreed. But speed without discipline is one failure. Speed without understanding why you failed is two failures.

The real keys: speed and clarity. Move fast, but know what you're building and why. That's what separates "shipped 3 products" from "shipped 3 products that lasted."
  strategy: "Personal Experience + Expert Insight - positions as middle generation with both perspectives, adds nuance on speed needing clarity"
```

## Notes

- Hagen Hübel is a developer/founder from Germany
- Post sparked good debate in comments
- Our comment adds Gen Y perspective (middle ground)
- Connects to our positioning on sustainable speed
- Aligns with our "snowball" thesis without repeating it
