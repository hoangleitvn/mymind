## Original Post

The end of dashboards and design systems. Design systems in Figma may become obsolete with AI. AI replacing speed and creativity aspects of design systems. Provocative take on future of design workflows.

    Don't the design systems make the implementation work with AI easier and more scalable? I fully agree that design systems with their current 'human' dogmas will become obsolete. However, I had a chance to experiment with AI, and it's much easier to design components' behaviour with a quite complete system of theirs.

    You say that design systems are created to provide consistency and speed, but stifle creativity. And that speed and creativity are being replaced by using AI. But we still need consistency (in large number of screen contexts). Perhaps design systems evolve to be a set of regulatory prompts that are included when AI is asked to produce a new screen.

    Interesting take. I'm inclined to agree, because, the other day, I watched a whole course on design systems and by the end of it something didn't sit well with me. While it makes sense for huge projects, on a smaller scale, it really seemed like a way of avoiding design.

    Interesting take. I see it differently.

    Dashboards and design systems aren't ending. They're evolving.

    The shift I see:
    2025 - we design for users (I click what I want)
    2030 - we design with users (I say/gesture what I want)
    2050 - we design as users (I think/feel what I want)

    AI doesn't replace design systems. It changes how we create and maintain them. The consistency problem doesn't disappear. The workflow does.

    I've been exploring this in my research:

    Curious how you see this evolution playing out?
  strategy: "Respectful Disagreement + Thoughtful Question - acknowledge perspective, offer alternative view with vision timeline, invite discussion"
```

## Notes

- Michal Malewicz posted a provocative take on AI making design systems obsolete
- Generated discussion about whether design systems will disappear or evolve
- Related to my design research and writing platform 2030 concept
- Vision timeline: 2025 design for users, 2030 design with users, 2050 design as users
