## Original Post

Solutions Architecture is a career you learn by doing, not by studying. Customer conversations, design decisions, trade-offs navigation, production incidents - these experiences build the skills that matter. Certifications help, but they're not the foundation. The foundation is accumulated practice.

    This mirrors how I think about senior engineering roles in general. You can't study your way into judgment. The pattern recognition that separates architects from senior engineers comes from sitting through enough production incidents, trade-off debates, and "that seemed like a good idea at the time" moments.

    One addition: the fastest path is finding architects who've already paid the tuition of failure. Learning by doing is essential, but learning from someone who's seen the failure modes you haven't encountered yet compounds faster.
  strategy: "Add depth - extend to all senior engineering roles, add mentorship angle"
```

## Notes

- Anti-certification-fetishism resonates with practical-engineering angle
- Extended to all senior engineering roles, not just Solutions Architecture
- Added mentorship as acceleration mechanism
- Connects to duct-tape-programmer and learning-from-failure themes
