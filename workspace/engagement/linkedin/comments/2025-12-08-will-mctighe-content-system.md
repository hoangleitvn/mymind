Systems over inspiration. This is the part most people underestimate.

The "pick pain points you've actually heard from customers" step is key. AI gives you volume, real conversations give you accuracy.

Saving this framework.
    strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Validates systems approach. Highlights specific valuable step (real conversations > pure AI). Non-promotional, stays visible in content creator space."
