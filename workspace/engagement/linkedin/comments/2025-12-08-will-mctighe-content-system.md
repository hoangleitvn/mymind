    The only trap I see with AI generated lists is people skipping real conversations, so pairing this with regular calls and DMs keeps the content sharp.

    Systems over inspiration. This is the part most people underestimate.

    The "pick pain points you've actually heard from customers" step is key. AI gives you volume, real conversations give you accuracy.

    Saving this framework.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Validates systems approach. Highlights specific valuable step (real conversations > pure AI). Non-promotional, stays visible in content creator space."
```

## Notes

- Major LinkedIn creator (421K followers) in content creation space
- We're building content creation framework (Mizemind) - relevant to track
- Good visibility opportunity
- Non-promotional engagement to stay in network
