Totally agreed. We need to ask the right question. Instead of "will AI replace us" ask "how do we work differently, learn new skills, build systems that actually work with AI?"

We're building software. We can't just plug AI into our old workflow and expect magic. We need to build systems where AI is the multiplier, shows its speed, while we still control and monitor every single line of code.

That's the shift.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Share opinion directly, first person perspective"

## Notes

- Aligns with embedded CTO positioning on AI-assisted development
- Opportunity to connect on workforce transformation theme
- Reinforces "build systems that work" approach
