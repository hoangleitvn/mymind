## Original Post

To Vibe or Not I'm embracing the term "vibe coding." With reservations. And for products going to customers? I'll always call it AI Augmented Development. But we need to talk about when to vibe and when to be a disciplined developer. When to practice engineering. Vibe coding for exploration? Absolutely brilliant. Finding product-market fit. Rapid prototyping. The 0th draft of a product. This is where vibe coding shines. Vibe coding for production? Dangerous. Production code must be understood, maintained, secured, scaled. "It works, ship it" without knowing why is technical debt on steroids. Even Andrej Karpathy — who coined the term — recently hand-coded his latest project because AI agents "just didn't work well enough." The godfather of vibe coding doesn't trust it for serious work. Here's the experience gap: Seasoned practitioners know when they're exploring vs. building for keeps. They vibe intentionally. Less experienced developers can't always tell the difference. Everything feels like exploration. Until it's in production and breaks at 3am. Vibe to explore. Engineer to ship. Do you know which mode you're in?

I much prefer "vibe prototyping" whenever I can use the term! Using Cursor effectively beyond the prototyping phase feels like a very different skill. Almost like being an "AI auditor" or "AI orchestrator". It becomes critical to understand the nitty-gritty of the code that the AI's coming up with as soon as it rolls into production - or otherwise it just amplifies chaos.

Yes, absolutely with you. As others outlined already, Vibe coding has it's place in prototyping. Getting something together, make progress, explore. But surely not for anything that goes into production. But that's the role of a proper CTO: make a call when it is ok to vibe and when to use "the proper way"

I think the term is a rather unprofessional and pretty dumb meme term in general. Karpathy said it in a way that was borderline mocking. He said: "It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing". He's since distanced himself from the term.

The experience gap is the real issue. Seasoned devs vibe to explore, then switch to engineering mode. They know the difference.

Junior devs can prompt but can't debug when it breaks. And AI-generated code will break. Without mental models of how things work, they're stuck.

Vibe to explore, engineer to ship. Good framing.

Yes, 100% agreement here.

I have talked about this in the past and will in the future.

In our traditional career life-cycle for software engineers (and knowledge workers in general), is the "directed contribution" stage.

With AI Augmented Development, that stage has / is quickly disappeared.

As an industry, we need to figure out how to handle this change, least we face a world where we don't have the next generation of software engineers.

Agreed. The traditional path (junior → contributor → senior) assumed juniors would struggle with small tasks, fail, learn, repeat. AI removes the struggle part.

Maybe the answer is explicit "AI-free" training projects. Build the mental models first, then add AI as a multiplier.

What have you seen work for developing engineers in AI-heavy environments?

For me the traditional model is:
Directed Contribution
Independent Contribution
Work through others

Don't focus on seniority

Focus on behaviours

I don't think we can or should AI, we need to adapt to it.

We need to be teaching and developing more product thinking

Perhaps bring people into engineering via an AI PM route

I do think one key skill is teaching people to read code very early on!

This is critical.

Asking people to not use AI is like saying you should write assembly before you write Python

Years ago leading a small team, I told people: I'm here to help, but I can't do it for you. Then I tracked how much time each person needed from me weekly. Over time, that dependency dropped. That's how I knew they were growing.

I evaluate people on behavior and mindset, not years. How they ask questions. How they produce outcomes. Closing tickets is easy. Building mental models that stay with them for years is harder.

And agreed on AI. We can't tell teams to stop using it just because we struggle to validate results. We need to figure out the gaps. AI PM route is an interesting path forward.
  strategy: "Personal experience + Agreement + Acknowledge his AI PM suggestion"

## Notes

- Aligns with my AI bubble vs snowball post and vibe coding themes
- Jordan focuses on AI fluency and tech leadership workshops
- Good engagement opportunity on a topic I've written about
- Post is fresh (3h old) - good timing for engagement
