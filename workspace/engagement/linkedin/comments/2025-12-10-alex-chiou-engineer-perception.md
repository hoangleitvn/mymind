## Original Post

Many engineers struggle in their career, because they refuse to accept who the true winner is between these 2 engineers: Engineer A: Works really hard and gets stuff done but they don't look productive to leadership Engineer B: Pretty lazy and doesn't get much done but they seem productive to leadership due to their communication skills I've seen many of both A and B, and B wins 99.9% of the time while A is incredibly likely to get fired. The harsh truth is that perception is far more important than reality. In an ideal world they would always be aligned, but that's not the world we live in. To become a true rockstar, become engineer C - Get stuff done and everyone perceives you as so.

    So the real promotion path is: A → learns to talk like B → evolves into C. It's basically Pokemon but with Jira tickets.

    Engineer A should build their own thing. No sense in casting pearls before swine.

    First, do the work well and get it done. Then learn communication skills to make your contributions visible.

    The company won't wait for you to figure this out. You need to evolve and transform into new roles where you multiply your impact, not just add to it.

    A stays an A forever. C keeps growing.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Simple, direct, adds evolution framing"
