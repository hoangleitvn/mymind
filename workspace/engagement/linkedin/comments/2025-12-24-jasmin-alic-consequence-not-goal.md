## Original Post

You're seeing many "what to do in 2026" posts. But I wish you could read this one: This contains 3 mindset "switches" that have redefined how I approach business this year. And life. 1. Chasing more money won't make you happy. I've seen many colleagues, many friends... chase a bigger income as their goal. Only to be left disappointed. Money is never the goal. It's a consequence. 2. Chasing more leads won't grow your business. I've seen too many fall into the trap of more leads, more leads... But how many "clients" do you really need?! A business won't run if you run after leads 24/7. 3. Chasing a high of dopamine all the time is not sustainable. You won't feel it. But it creeps in. Oh, it catches up to you. Taking breaks? Mandatory. If you don't nurture yourself, you can't nurture others. On that note, start the last one immediately. Go touch some grass. (or snow) Happy holidays! - Coach J (Repost for others) P.S. Are you pausing your LinkedIn activity? Or slowing down, at least? Tell me your holiday strategy.

    I love this insight, and I will say it's fully subjective and personal... I came for cash I focused on cash Creating the cash I wanted has made me happier than ever... Money should be the goal, when it needs to be the goal, and not when it doesn't.

    Fewer leads are enough if they're the right ones. Can't touch snow, so grass it is :)

    This hit home. NEVER Chase for outcome (money, leads, dopamine), they are consequences, not goals.

    I see the same pattern in engineering. They chase velocity, feature shipped, core coverage - treating metrics as the goals. But these are consequence too. Consequences of understanding the problem deeply first.

    For leads, fully agreed. Instead of chasing new clients, spend time to learn and help existing ones. It brings more value. And ironically, more referrals.

    Money follows value. Velocity follows clarity. Both require slowing down before speeding up.
  strategy: "Add angle - extend insight to engineering context, reinforce leads point with client focus"
```
