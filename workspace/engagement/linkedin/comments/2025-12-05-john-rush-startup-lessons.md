## Original Post

If only someone told me this before my 1st startup: 1. Validate. I wasted at least 5 years building stuff nobody needed. 2. Kill your EGO. Make your users happy instead of yourself. 3. Don't chase investors; chase users, and then investors will chase you. 4. Never hire managers. Only hire doers until PMF. 5. Landing page isn't important. Go for an average template and edit texts, and that's it. The sale happens outside of the website anyway (in the early stages). 6. Hire only full-stack devs. There is nothing less productive in this world than a team of developers. One full stack dev building the whole product. That's it. 7. Chase global market from day 1. If the product and marketing are good, it will work on the global market too, if it's bad, it won't work on the local market too. So better go global from day 1, so that if it works, the upside is 100x bigger. 8. Do SEO from day 2. As early as you can. I ignored this for 14 years. It's my biggest regret. 9. Sell features, before building them. Ask existing users if they want this feature. I run DMs with 10-20 users every day, where I chat about all my ideas and features I wanna add. I clearly see what resonates with me most and only go build those. 10. Hire only people you'd wanna hug. My mentor said this to me in 2015. And it was a big shift. I realized that if I don't wanna hug the person, it means I dislike them. Sooner or later, we would have a conflict and eventually break up. 11. Invest all your money into yourself and your friends. I did some math; if I kept investing all my money into all my friends' startups, I'd be worth $100M+ by now. 12. Post on X/Linkedin daily. I started posting here in 2023. I wish I started earlier. It's my primary source of new connections, news, marketing, and networking. 13. Don't work/partner with corporates. They seem like a fantastic opportunity; they promise millions of users, etc. But none of this happens. Cuz you talk to a regular employees there. They waste your time, destroy focus, shift priorities, and eventually bring in no users/money. 14. Don't get ever distracted by hype, e.g. crypt0. I lost years of my life this way. I met the worst people along the way. Fricks, scammers, thieves. Some of my close friends turned into thieves along the way. 15. Don't build consumer apps. Only b2b. 16. Don't hold on the bad project for too long. 17. Tech conferences are a waste of time. 18. Scrum is a Scam. If I had a team that had to be nagged every morning with questions as if they were kindergarten children, things would eventually fail. Once I killed scrum, things changed; lazy folks left, grownups entered my team & we've been concurring the world. 19. Outsource nothing until PMF. 20. Bootstrap. I raised over 10 times, preseed, seed, and series A. Today I bootstrap all my startups. The difference is huge. I'm totally obsessed with products & users now, while in the past, I was obsessed with funding rounds, events, news coverage.

Point 6 (One full-stack dev > Team) is the ultimate cheat code for early stage velocity. The communication overhead of a team often slows down product development more than the extra hands help. As a solo builder, I've found that moving at the speed of thought without having to sync, ticket, or debate is the only way to compete with the big guys

Great tips and concepts! Thanks for sharing. I don't agree fully on the landing page one, since I really noticed good strategy starts with translation to messaging, improving your focus on creation value for the end user. Not the features. But really solving something (like you said; ask your users). Good strategy translated to good messaging, and then put into HTML for people to read and buy/engage with your business online is pure magic.

The validating and user focus parts hit hard. A lot of people fall in love with building and forget to check if anyone actually wants it. Which of these took you the longest to learn?

Solid list. Point 18 caught my attention. Curious how you transitioned the team after dropping scrum. Did you move to something structured (Kanban, async standups) or go fully autonomous? And how long before the "lazy folks" self-selected out?

Point 19 hits different for me. I run a dev shop and see both sides. What drove your "nothing until PMF" stance? Bad outsourcing experiences, or more about keeping everything in-house for speed and context?
  strategy: "Thoughtful Question - asking about specific points that relate to my experience (scrum transition) and my business context (outsourcing)"

## Notes

- John Rush is a serial founder with 45K followers
- Strong opinions, direct communication style
- His "outsource nothing" stance directly relates to our business
- Worth building relationship to understand founder perspective on outsourcing
- His scrum experience aligns with our views on process overhead
- Consider follow-up if he responds, could be valuable discussion
