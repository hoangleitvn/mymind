## Original Post

3 years since ChatGPT launched, I finally unsubscribed.

The free version was great, the models kept improving, and the Studio Ghibli image generator was a nice gimmick. But GPT-5 showed diminishing returns and constantly overthinks every question I ask (it once spent 67 seconds thinking through a simple Arduino Uno plant waterer implementation plan).

Thanks to ChatGPT, a family of models emerged—Gemini, Claude, and open-source champions like DeepSeek. At some point, they all started behaving the same despite performance improvements.

So the question becomes: which model provider has the best interface? How long do I wait for an answer? Is that answer even factual?

That's when I looked at my subscription bill: £70+ per month across Claude, ChatGPT, Midjourney, Google, etc. Looking at my actual usage, I barely touched a fraction of it—unlike Apple One or Surfshark, which I use daily.

Call me old-school, but I still enjoy reading information from the internet, Wikipedia, and even Stack Overflow to draw my own conclusions (though it's getting harder with AI slop drowning out genuine human work).

I'm sticking with Claude because of Claude Code, and Opus excels at generating simple tasks without excessive configuration.

The lesson? The ROI of "having all the AIs" is minimal.

In the age of commoditized intelligence, the differentiator isn't the model—it's the interface and how effectively you use it.

Someone on X joked that BC now stands for Before ChatGPT. Three years in, maybe we're finally past the hype phase and entering the "figure out what actually works" era.

I cancelled a while ago and switched to t3.chat - multiple models still useful. The big problem is memory.

Disagree, its about using multiple models at the same time to analyze each others ideas

ChatGPT is unusable for code tasks. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is pretty nice but about as good as a college intern.

Same conclusion here. Consolidated to Claude Code and haven't looked back.

The "figure out what actually works" era is right. Most productivity gains come from how you integrate AI into your workflow, not which model you pick.

## Notes

- Active poster (669 posts), good engagement
- Claude Code user - shared interest
- "Figure out what works" framing aligns with practical approach
- Good potential connection for AI/developer content
