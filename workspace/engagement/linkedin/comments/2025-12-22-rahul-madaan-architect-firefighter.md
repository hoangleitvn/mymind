## Original Post

If you hire a Lead Engineer to build your architecture but use them to fix "Login issues" and "Local setup" tickets... You aren't being "Agile." You are burning your most expensive resource on Tier 1 support. I've seen companies pay $200k+ for a "Visionary Architect" and then drown them in "silly" Jira tickets. "I can't get Docker to run on my Mac." "The staging login is redirecting weird." "Can you help me install this CLI tool?" Every time a Lead jumps in to "quickly fix" a small dev issue, they aren't being a "team player." They are failing at their real job: Building the system that makes those tickets unnecessary. Stop "Helping", Start Architecting. In a high-performing team, if a Lead has to hand-hold a developer through a setup issue, the Platform is broken. Here is how I stop the "Firefighting" cycle: 1. The "Golden Path" Onboarding: If "Setup" is a ticket, your automation failed. Use Dev Containers or Ephemeral Environments. A new dev should be able to run one command and have a working environment in 5 minutes. No Lead required. 2. Self-Service Documentation: If I have to answer the same "Login" question twice, I don't answer it a third time. I write a troubleshooting doc and link it. If the doc doesn't fix it, we fix the code, not the user. 3. The "High-Value" Filter: As a Lead, I ask: "If I spend an hour on this, does it fix the problem for one person or the whole team?" If it's just one person, it's a distraction. If it's the whole team, it's a Systemic Design Problem. A Lead's value isn't measured by how many tickets they "solve". It's measured by how many types of tickets they eliminate through better design. Stop hiring architects and asking them to paint the fence. The Question: Be honest: Are you currently an "Architect" or just a "High-Paid Firefighter"?

    Absolutely spot-on, Rahul. It's crucial to ensure that Lead Engineers are leveraging their skills to build resilient systems rather than getting bogged down with routine support tasks. Your emphasis on systemic improvements and robust onboarding processes resonates deeply with maintaining operational excellence.

    Seriously, couldn't agree more. Rather than taking developer's productivity as a critical thing, most organizations treat it as an afterthought. IMO developer's productivity, is the single most effective thing which drives operational excellence.

    This is really about leadership mindset. Your job as a lead is to see where your team hits friction, feels the pain, then fix it by creating standards, refining process.

    Solving tickets one by one feels productive. Building the system that makes those tickets disappear? That's the actual job.

    As an IC, your value = code you ship. As a leader, your value = code your team ships.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement + Self-reference - reinforces leadership angle and links to own content naturally"
