## Original Post

"I built an app in 3 hours" sounds impressive. But Cursor just hit $200M in projected revenue while teams discover the hard truth: demos aren't products.

AI vibe coding tools are getting lots of traction. Cursor reached 360,000 paying customers, GitHub Copilot hit 1.3 million paid users, and developers are building entire apps in hours.

But an increase in AI usage leads to a decrease in delivery stability. Think about it:

- Production readiness still takes 3-6 months after the initial demo
- AI vibe coding tools are cash generative businesses, but devs now spend more time debugging AI-generated code
- The fastest demos become the slowest deployments when nobody thought about state management upfront

This is where Vercel, Replit, and Anthropic are quietly winning. They're not just selling speed. They're building deployment infrastructure, error boundaries, and production monitoring that AI-generated code desperately needs.

The real opportunity isn't shipping faster, it's knowing when to constrain the AI before your first production incident teaches you the expensive way.

In 2026, I think the market will split into 2 camps: teams using AI to prototype fast and stabilize smart, vs teams drowning in technical debt from copy-paste chaos.

The winners won't be the ones who built fastest. They'll be the ones who understood that AI code is like startup runway: how you spend it matters more than how much you have.

    Push back on 'vibe coding' gatekeeping framing. AI code is not inherently bad. Constraints are useful in general, not just for AI.

    Demos like university projects - build it, get the grade, never maintain. Production is liability with skin in the game.

    Agreed. 2026+, we will deal with tech debt plug validation debt.

    Here's the reality: if you can't explain why it works, you don't ship it. You own it. You built it today. Future you debugs it at midnight.

    That ownership doesn't disappear because AI helped write it.

    Curious: what's your validation rule before shipping AI code?
