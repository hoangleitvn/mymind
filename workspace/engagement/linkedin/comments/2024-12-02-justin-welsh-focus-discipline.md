## Original Post

Stay locked in.

No time for drama.
No time for gossip.
No time for comparisons.

Just you and your progress.

Most people waste energy on things that don't matter.
Scrolling. Complaining. Watching what everyone else is doing.

But the people who win?
They're too busy building.

I learned this the hard way.
When I was stuck, I was distracted.
When I was growing, I was locked in.

The difference wasn't talent.
It was focus.

Discipline isn't about doing more.
It's about eliminating everything that doesn't move you forward.

Your growth demands your full attention.
Everything else is noise.

Lived this. The trap wasn't obvious distractions. It was "productive" ones. Watching what competitors shipped. Reading every new framework launch. Feeling behind.

Switching to "head down, execute the plan" changed everything. Both in engineering and content. Progress compounds when you stop comparing.
  strategy: "Personal Experience - Shares authentic experience, connects to both engineering and content contexts, adds insight about 'productive distractions' trap."
