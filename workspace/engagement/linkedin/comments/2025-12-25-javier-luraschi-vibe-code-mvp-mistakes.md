## Original Post

I see 5 common mistakes when non-technical founders vibe code their AI MVPs:

1. Fake data that breaks in production - AI generates placeholder data that looks real but fails with actual inputs
2. Feature creep from easy addition - "Just one more feature" compounds when AI makes adding easy
3. Security holes from speed focus - Authentication and data validation get skipped for shipping fast
4. No version control means no rollback - When things break, there's no way to recover previous working state
5. Generic products from same tools/prompts - Using the same AI with similar prompts produces similar outputs

The differentiation isn't in the vibe coding itself. It's in the validation work before you start.

    The "generic products" point is underrated. When everyone uses the same AI tools with the same prompts, you get the same outputs. The differentiation isn't in the vibe coding itself. It's in the validation work before you start: understanding what users actually need, not what's easy to build.

    We see this with clients regularly. The ones who spend a week talking to 10 real users before writing code ship something different. The ones who jump straight to building ship something that looks like everything else on Product Hunt.
  strategy: "Add depth - extend point 5 (generic products) with validation-first solution"
```

## Notes

- Javier offers Fractional CTO services (similar positioning)
- Engage as peer expert, not competitor - shared audience = visibility opportunity
- Point 5 (generic products) connects to our build-with-users and validation-first themes
- Content opportunity: write own post on vibe coding from discovery angle
