## Original Post

Microservices are solution to a problem you probably don't have. Startups with 5 engineers managing 20 microservices = distributed monolith. Build modular monolith first. Break out only when you need independent scaling or have separate team.

    Agree. Premature microservices kill velocity. We've seen it too many times.

    Modular monolith first. Break out only when team size or scale demands it.
  strategy: "Supportive agreement - aligns with my stated architecture philosophy, short and direct"
```

## Notes

- Rahul argues for modular monolith over premature microservices
- Aligns perfectly with my architecture philosophy
- Uses my exact phrase "premature microservices kill velocity"
