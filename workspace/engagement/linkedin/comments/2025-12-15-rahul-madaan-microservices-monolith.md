Agree. Premature microservices kill velocity. We've seen it too many times.

Modular monolith first. Break out only when team size or scale demands it.
    strategy: "Supportive agreement - aligns with my stated architecture philosophy, short and direct"

## Post Analysis

Rahul argues for modular monolith over premature microservices. Aligns perfectly with my architecture philosophy from whoami.md: "Designed and scaled products with monolith/modular architecture and microservices" and tech-leader persona: "Premature microservices kill velocity."

## Comment Strategy

Short agreement that reinforces the point with credibility from experience. Uses my exact phrase "premature microservices kill velocity."
