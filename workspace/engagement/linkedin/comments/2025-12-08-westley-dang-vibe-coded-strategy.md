"Coders don't vibe-code production software. Why do founders ship vibe-coded company strategy?"

AI can accelerate thinking. It can't replace it. The gap between live conversation and written output reveals who's actually doing the work.
    strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Quote his best line for visibility. Validate core insight. Short and punchy to match his tone."
