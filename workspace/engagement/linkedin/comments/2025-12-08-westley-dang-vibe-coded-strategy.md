## Original Post

Westley Dang (VC) calling out founders who send AI-generated homework instead of original thinking. Key insight: the discrepancy between live meetings and written content reveals who's actually thinking vs outsourcing to AI.

    AI can be a useful accelerator, but the founder still has to supply the actual thinking.

    "Coders don't vibe-code production software. Why do founders ship vibe-coded company strategy?"

    This line hits hard.

    AI can accelerate thinking. It can't replace it. The gap between live conversation and written output reveals who's actually doing the work.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Quote his best line for visibility. Validate core insight. Short and punchy to match his tone."
```

## Notes

- Sharp observation about AI use in founder/VC dynamics
- Relevant to our positioning (ownership, doing the work)
- Good line worth amplifying
