## Original Post

I'm genuinely a little worried about the next generation of developers. AI coding tools are incredible. They make you faster, unblock you, and help you explore ideas you might not have tried before. That part is real. But there's a growing risk that people skip the fundamentals entirely and never build the mental models that actually matter. When something breaks in production, there's no autocomplete prompt that saves you. You need to understand why the system behaves the way it does. You need to reason about data flows, edge cases, performance, failure modes, and trade-offs. That only comes from doing the boring, uncomfortable, hard parts yourself at least once. AI should accelerate learning, not replace it. We still need to train developers to think, debug, design, and struggle a bit. At Invofox, AI helps us move faster, but our engineers' ideas and design skills are what actually solve hard problems.

    This is the skill gap nobody talks about. I just also wrote a post about how juniors or even engineers should use AI to avoid skill gaps.

    AI doesn't teach you why systems behave a certain way. It just produces code. The debugging, the edge cases, the "why did this fail" reasoning, that comes from struggle. Without mental models, it is really hard to figure out, especially when you are in 10 minutes report loop.

    Engineers who skip the fundamentals eventually hit a wall where AI can't help them. The foundation has to exist first.
  strategy: "Expert Insight - Validates concern, references own content on topic, reinforces fundamentals-first thesis"
```

## Notes

- Fresh post (14 min old) - excellent early visibility opportunity
- No comments yet - first mover advantage
- Alberto is CTO at Invofox - genuine concern, not performative
- Strong alignment with your architect mindset and vibe coding critique content
- "AI amplifies existing knowledge" is your core thesis - good reinforcement
