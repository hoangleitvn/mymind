## Original Post

At this point, it's clear this isn't about "prompt writing" anymore. It's about building systems. Figma Make and Magic Patterns benefit from clarity. Vague direction produces vague output. If you haven't already, start creating fine-tuned markdown files that serve as the backbone of your prototypes. These files define the prototype's purpose, layout rules, components, states, data expectations, and interaction patterns. Once that exists, the AI is essentially interpreting specs and not guessing at requests. Prototype templates matter just as much. If you invest early in a strong base prototype, you can clone/fork it and spin up different flavors quickly. Variations, experiments, edge cases. All were built off the same core instead of being rebuilt from scratch. You'll save a ton of tokens and headaches. Design systems are non-negotiable here. Both tools support them. Correct component names, real spacing, typography tokens, and shared variables can and should exist in your prototypes. When needed, you can wire in real data or services so the prototype behaves closer to production instead of feeling like a static mock. In today's market, speed matters. Being able to turn ideas into working prototypes quickly is what helps teams get critical stakeholder alignment within hours and days, not weeks. As I write this, your competitor just made an iteration on one of their new concepts.

    I started out writing simple bash scripts on GitHub but I have training in using Python for data science. AI gives me the ability to write full stack code in Python that I can check because of my data science training. I love vibe coding. If it works, you have succeeded.

    This matches what I've learned building my own system. Fine-tuned markdown files aren't just for prototypes. They work for any AI workflow.

    I run my entire content creation through markdown: instructions, rules, guardrails. The AI pulls this context with every prompt. Results went from "interesting but off" to "exactly what I meant."

    The breakthrough: AI interprets specs, not guesses at requests. Same principle you're describing.

    What format do you use for your layout rules and interaction patterns?
  strategy: "Personal Experience - Validates thesis with broader application (content creation), ends with question to invite dialogue"
```

## Notes

- Post aligns strongly with your markdown-based system approach
- Paul focuses on design tools (Figma Make, Magic Patterns), you extend to content workflows
- Good opportunity to connect on systems thinking
- Consider follow-up if he engages with the question about his format
