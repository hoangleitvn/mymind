## Original Post

Platform Engineering is no longer a theory — it's a reality, already delivering outcomes where reliability is critical. In the UK, Fujitsu is helping organisations cut through complexity and move at pace — improving speed to value, boosting security, and empowering developers with automation and self-service. Even in mission-critical environments, we're enabling transformation without compromise. ⚙️Real deployment. 🔏Proven security. 🚀Rapid innovation.

Platform engineering done right is a force multiplier. The self-service piece is where most teams get stuck. They build the platform but forget the developer experience.

We're working on similar problems with our clients. Would be good to exchange notes sometime.
  strategy: "Expert Insight + Connection intent - adds perspective on developer experience gap, opens door for future connection"
