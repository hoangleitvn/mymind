    For diagrams-as-code, I've found that the real challenge isn't the tool itself, but integrating the diagram generation into the CI/CD pipeline so it stays current with the codebase.

    Choosing the right tool often depends on lifecycle: early-stage teams benefit from visual tools like IcePanel or Excalidraw, while mature systems get the most value from Structurizr or diagrams-as-code.

    Great list. We use both: drawing tools (Draw.io, Miro, Lucidchart) for quick whiteboarding, and diagrams-as-code (C4 with Structurizr, PlantUML, Mermaid, Python Diagrams) for documentation that lives with the code.

    I'm a fan of diagrams-as-code. Now exploring how to integrate into CI/CD pipelines and auto-generate diagrams from code with consistent branding.

    Curious: how do you enforce diagramming standards or branding across teams?
  strategy: "Personal Experience + Thoughtful Question - shares real tool usage, then asks genuine question about standardization"
