## Original Post

Your architecture diagrams are lying to you. And even worse, your team is making decisions based on them. Outdated diagrams. Inconsistent notation. Different people drawing different versions of the "truth." It's no surprise teams struggle to align on architecture when everyone is looking at a different picture. This is exactly why I created a free eBook on the C4 model. The C4 model gives you a structured, layered way to communicate architecture that doesn't fall apart the moment the system changes. Instead of boxes-and-lines chaos, you get clear, consistent views, from high-level context to concrete containers and components, all designed for the audience who needs them. In the eBook, I walk through a real e-commerce modernization and show how the C4 model helps teams reason about design, boundaries, and responsibilities. You'll also find interactive IcePanel diagrams you can explore directly from the live project behind the guide. I'm sharing a short extract below. Get the full PDF + the interactive model here: https://lnkd.in/eb_Cmecd If your #architecture feels unclear, inconsistent, or impossible to communicate, this will change how you document systems going forward. #c4model #diagrams #architecture

We use both C4 and IcePanel. Do you have any diagrams of MFE using C4?

Big fan of C4. We also use UML in some contexts.

One thing I see: teams create one diagram and expect it to serve everyone. It never does. A CTO/CIO needs solution building blocks, while architects and developers need architecture building blocks. Each persona needs different views of the same system, and C4 solves this with its 4-layered approach.

Another challenge: diagrams often become outdated and inconsistent. So teams are looking into diagram-as-code (Mermaid, PlantUML, etc.). I'm building a foundation that attaches branding and guidelines, then uses AI to speed up generation.

What's your experience with diagram-as-code approaches? How do you enforce consistency for your teams?
  strategy: "Expert Insight + Thoughtful Question - Shares practical experience, validates C4 value, opens discussion about diagram-as-code"
