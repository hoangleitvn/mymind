## Original Post

The message is getting trough. you need a full stack platform: from chip, to models, to ops, to agents to get the real innovation https://lnkd.in/d_H4WJ3r "OpenAI just declared "Code Red" as Google and others catch up. But here's what matters for operators. It's not about which model is best today. It's about which platform you can actually build on. Google owns Android, Chrome, Search, Gmail, Docs. These are massive platforms where agents will live. Microsoft owns Azure and enterprise infrastructure. Amazon owns e-commerce infrastructure. OpenAI has ChatGPT's user interface, which is huge, but they don't own the platforms where most business work happens. My take is that 2026 will be the year of agents. Not because the tech suddenly works, it's been working. But because the platforms are mature enough that non-AI-scientist engineers can deploy them, and non-engineers can manage them."

    This is the definitive shift from 'model wars' to 'ecosystem wars'. You nailed the critical differentiator: Contextual State. OpenAI has the brain (model) but Google/Microsoft own the Nervous System (OS, Browser, Email, Docs). An agent living inside the platform doesn't just have lower latency; it has implicit permission and context.

    This is why chasing the "best model" is a trap. OpenAI has models, but no ecosystem. Google and Microsoft own where the work happens.

    I picked a platform that fits my stack, learned to design systems that work with it, then scaled. Make it work first. Multi-model optimization is a problem most teams will never actually need to solve.
  strategy: "Personal Experience + Expert Insight - Validate the ecosystem thesis with practical builder perspective, add pragmatic advice about model selection"
```

## Notes

- Antonio Gulli is at Google (searchguy handle suggests Search background)
- Post aligns with pragmatic builder mindset
- Good framing: platform wars > model wars
- Our comment reinforces the message and adds practical builder perspective
