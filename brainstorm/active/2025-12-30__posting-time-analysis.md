## Findings

**Day of Week:**
- Top 2 performers: Weekend posts (Saturday, Tuesday early)
- Mid-tier: Monday/Thursday mornings
- No clear "best day" - variety across the week

**Time Pattern:**
- Morning posts (7-9 AM local): 5 posts, avg ~4,477 impressions
- Afternoon posts (2-4 PM local): 2 posts, avg ~8,775 impressions

**US Audience Alignment (EST):**
- 8-9 AM Vietnam = 8-9 PM EST (previous day evening)
- 2-4 PM Vietnam = 2-4 AM EST (overnight)

## Conclusion

Sample size too small for definitive conclusions. Observations:
- Morning local time (7-9 AM) works consistently for 1k+ reach
- Weekend posts performed surprisingly well (top 2 posts)
- Early morning Vietnam aligns with evening US time

## Next Steps

- Continue tracking performance with larger sample
- Test afternoon posting (2-4 PM local) more frequently
- Compare weekday vs weekend performance with more data
