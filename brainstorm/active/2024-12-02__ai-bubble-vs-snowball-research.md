# AI Bubble vs Snowball: Research & Post Draft

**Date:** 2024-12-02
**Topic:** AI market speculation and vibe coding risks
**Purpose:** Research notes + LinkedIn post draft


## Part 1: Terminology Clarification

### Bubble vs Snowball - Key Differences

| Term | Meaning | Connotation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Bubble** | Asset prices inflated beyond intrinsic value by speculation; eventually "pops" | Temporary hype → crash |
| **Snowball** | Compounding effect—small things accumulate into something massive | Growth that builds momentum (positive OR negative) |

### Financial Bubble Characteristics
- Driven by speculation, herd mentality, overvaluation
- Asset prices rise unsustainably due to market psychology
- Eventually "bursts" causing rapid value loss
- Irrational exuberance and speculation

### Snowball Effect Characteristics
- Driven by compounding/accumulation (interest on interest)
- Exponential growth through accumulated gains or debts
- Continues growing unless actively stopped
- Mathematical compounding principle
- Can be positive (investments) or negative (debt/technical debt)

## Part 2: The AI Bubble Debate (2025)

### Evidence FOR a Bubble

**Scale of Investment:**
- Global AI capex + VC exceeds **$600B in 2025**
- Gartner estimates all AI-related spending might top **$1.5 trillion** in 2025
- 1,300+ AI startups valued over $100M; 498 AI "unicorns"

**Circular Investment Concerns:**
- Nvidia puts $100B into OpenAI → OpenAI buys Nvidia chips
- Some analysts say this structure artificially inflates actual demand

**High-Profile Skeptics:**
- **Peter Thiel** sold entire Nvidia stake (~$100M)
- **SoftBank** sold nearly $6B stake in Nvidia
- **Michael Burry** (Big Short) now betting against Nvidia
- **Sam Altman** (OpenAI CEO): "Are investors overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes."
- **Sundar Pichai** (Google CEO): "There are elements of irrationality" in AI market

**Fund Manager Sentiment:**
- 53% of surveyed investors believe AI stocks are in a bubble
- First time in 20 years fund managers say companies are "overinvesting"

### Evidence AGAINST a Bubble

**Valuations Not as Extreme:**
- Magnificent 7's P/E ratio is "roughly half" that of largest companies in late 1990s
- Goldman Sachs: valuations aren't nearly as stretched as dot-com era

**Viable Business Models:**
- AI companies have actual revenue and profits (unlike early dot-com)
- **Jerome Powell** (Fed Chair): "These companies actually have earnings"
- **Bob Michele** (JP Morgan): "We don't think we're in one now for AI"

**Bullish Analyst Views:**
- **Dan Ives** (Wedbush): "Fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated"
- **Howard Marks** (Oaktree): "Valuations are high, but not crazy"

### Key Risk to Watch
- AI infrastructure needs ~$2 trillion in annual revenue by end of decade to justify current investment
- Historical parallel: early-2000s telecom boom (fiber-optic overinvestment)

## Part 3: Vibe Coding - The Real Snowball Problem

### What is Vibe Coding?
- AI-assisted development where developer describes task to LLM
- LLM generates code based on prompt
- Developer does NOT review or edit the code
- Uses only execution results to evaluate and ask for improvements
- **Collins Dictionary Word of the Year 2025**
- Term popularized by Andrej Karpathy (February 2025)

### The Compounding Problems (Snowball Effect)

#### 1. Technical Debt Accumulates
- Inconsistent coding patterns emerge
- AI generates solutions without unified architectural vision
- Creates patchwork codebase where similar problems solved in dissimilar ways

#### 2. Security Vulnerabilities
- **40% of Copilot outputs contain security vulnerabilities** (out of 1,689 programs studied)
- Developers use AI code without fully comprehending functionality
- Undetected bugs, errors, security holes

#### 3. Skill Erosion
- Overreliance weakens developers' hands-on experience
- Junior devs turn to AI instead of learning to debug
- "Senior coders with problem-solving skills may become endangered species"

#### 4. Reduced Maintainability
- Knowledge silos form (only original prompt engineers understand code)
- Bug rates increase
- Developer frustration and turnover rise

#### 5. Skipped Quality Assurance
- **36% of vibe coders skip QA entirely**
- No unit tests, integration tests, or structured reviews
- Only validation: "does it run?"

#### 6. Developer Burnout
- "Engineers are burning out"
- Senior staff expected to review features that don't work
- "Development hell" when working with AI-generated vibe-code

#### 7. Enterprise Integration Challenges
- Bug-prone code lacks complete architectural structure
- Difficult to debug and integrate into enterprise systems
- "Fast and creative, but deeply unreliable for enterprise use"

### Industry Shift (Late 2025)
- "Vibe coding hangover" reported by Fast Company (September 2025)
- Shift from loose, vibes-based approach to systematic context management
- Rise of "context engineering" as response

## Part 4: Key Insight for Post

### Thesis
AI investment might be a **bubble** (market speculation that could pop), but vibe coding without engineering discipline is a **snowball** (compounding technical debt that grows worse over time).

- The bubble affects stock prices
- The snowball affects codebases

### No-Code vs Vibe Coding Comparison
- No-code/low-code had defined scope and constraints
- Vibe coding has no guardrails
- Produces code that *looks* professional but lacks architectural integrity
- The snowball isn't the tool itself—it's the accumulating mess when used without discipline


## Part 5: LinkedIn Post Draft

### Option A: Concise Version

**AI: Bubble or Snowball?**

Everyone's debating whether AI is a bubble.

But they're using the wrong metaphor for the real problem.

**Bubble** = prices inflated beyond value, eventually pops
**Snowball** = compounding effect that grows over time

AI investment might be a bubble. 53% of fund managers think so. Even Sam Altman admits investors are "overexcited."

But here's what concerns me more:

Vibe coding is a snowball.

The stats are alarming:
→ 40% of AI-generated code has security vulnerabilities
→ 36% of vibe coders skip testing entirely
→ Senior engineers report "development hell" reviewing AI-generated code

Each shortcut compounds. Each unreviewed function adds debt. Each skipped test creates a hole.

No-code/low-code had guardrails. Defined scope. Clear limitations.

Vibe coding produces code that *looks* professional but lacks architectural integrity.

The bubble might pop and hurt portfolios.
The snowball keeps rolling and crushes codebases.

Which one should we worry about more?


### Option B: More Detailed Version

**Is AI a Bubble? Wrong Question.**

The hot debate: Is AI investment a bubble?

Evidence says maybe:
• $600B+ in AI investment this year
• 53% of fund managers see a bubble
• Even OpenAI's CEO admits investors are "overexcited"

But bubbles pop. Markets recover. Life goes on.

Here's the real problem nobody's talking about:

**Vibe coding isn't a bubble. It's a snowball.**

Different metaphors. Different outcomes.

Bubble = speculation inflates prices → pop → reset
Snowball = small problems compound → exponential growth → avalanche

The numbers are brutal:
• 40% of Copilot outputs contain security vulnerabilities
• 36% of vibe coders skip QA entirely
• "Development hell" for senior engineers reviewing AI-generated chaos

Each unreviewed function adds technical debt.
Each skipped test creates a security hole.
Each "it works, ship it" decision compounds.

We had this conversation before with no-code/low-code.
But those tools had guardrails. Defined scope. Clear constraints.

Vibe coding has none. It produces code that *looks* professional but lacks architectural integrity.

The bubble hurts stock prices.
The snowball crushes codebases.

One corrects itself. The other keeps rolling.

Which should we worry about?
