## Core Framework

Matt's key insight on what makes posts go viral:

1. **Broadly understandable topics** - money, relationships, morning routines, AI
2. **Simple idea and packaging** - easy for anyone to read
3. **The post itself matters** - not timing, not engagement hacks

> "ANYONE can understand these posts. You don't need to know anything about the topic at hand."


## 6 Viral Post Examples (2025)

### Post 1: Revenue Breakdown (628 reactions)
**Type:** Transparency / Numbers
**Hook:** "My business goal: hit $300k in 2025. I'm at $292k."

```
My business goal: hit $300k in 2025.
I'm at $292k.

Here's the monthly revenue breakdown (so far):
Jan → $17,936
Feb → $19,668
Mar → $12,336
...
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific numbers create credibility
- Month-by-month breakdown is scannable
- Ends with tools list (actionable)
- Personal but universally interesting (money)

**Pattern:** Goal → Progress → Breakdown → Tools → Question


### Post 2: Morning Routine Disaster (768 reactions)
**Type:** Relatable Story / Humor
**Hook:** "I'm 32. No kids. I run a one person writing business. Yesterday's morning routine was perfect:"

```
- wake up to my alarm and hit stop
- go back to sleep for 45 minutes
- get up, go downstairs, make coffee
- back to bed to drink coffee
...
- completely forget about the lentils
- overcooked lentils into mush
- got annoyed and threw a strop
```

**Why it works:**
- Anti-hustle culture (refreshing)
- Self-deprecating humor
- Unexpected twist (lentils → soup)
- Ends with sarcastic question

**Pattern:** Setup (who I am) → "Perfect" routine → Disaster → Recovery → Punchline


### Post 3: AI Ghost-writing Roast (447 reactions)
**Type:** Contrarian / Critique
**Hook:** "On Monday I saw a post by Spencer Matthews. It was SO obviously written by AI, it was laughable."

```
Nobody talks like this! NO. BODY.

Spencer, man:
We've watched you on MIC.
We know how you talk.
And it is nothing like this 😂
```

**Why it works:**
- Names a specific person (bold)
- Points out obvious problem others think but don't say
- Provides actionable tips (not just criticism)
- Shows expertise through specific advice

**Pattern:** Observation → Call-out → Why it's bad → 7 tips to fix → CTA


### Post 4: Monthly Revenue + Tools (783 reactions)
**Type:** Transparency / Tool Stack
**Hook:** "This month, my little business did $27,034 with:"

```
- $0 payroll (apart from myself)
- Just 2 client calls/week
- 2-3 hours/week writing LinkedIn content

I save 100s of hours, $1,000s on payroll and generate $1,000s more because I use these 10 tools:
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific number in hook
- "Little business" = humble flex
- Tool list is actionable
- Each tool has clear purpose (saves time/money/makes money)

**Pattern:** Result → Constraints → Tools list with purpose → Question


### Post 5: Anti-Hustle Manifesto (1,010 reactions - HIGHEST)
**Type:** Values / Anti-establishment
**Hook:** "I'm a simple guy. I don't need to:"

```
- be a keynote speaker
- fly first class
- tell the world i'm an entrepreneur
- portray myself as some sort of F list celebrity
...

I'm the complete opposite. I prefer to:
- fly economy but treat myself to extra legroom
- just do the work instead of looking busy
```

**Why it works:**
- Contrarian to LinkedIn culture
- Two-column comparison (don't need vs prefer)
- Self-deprecating humor at end
- Touches universal desire for authenticity

**Pattern:** What I don't need (list) → What I prefer (list) → Self-aware joke


### Post 6: Life Transformation Timeline (756 reactions)
**Type:** Before/After Journey
**Hook:** "6 years ago:"

```
6 years ago:
- Single
- 28lbs overweight
- Living in a 6-bed house share in London

5 years ago:
- Met Serine
- Lost 36lbs
- Moved in with my best mate Brad (upgrade)
...

Today?
- Sun (or shade if it's 40c heat)
- Health
- Love
- Wealth
```

**Why it works:**
- Clear timeline structure
- Specific details (28lbs, 6-bed house, Northern Line)
- Relatable struggles → aspirational outcome
- Ends with accessible call to action

**Pattern:** Timeline (years ago → today) → What changed → Lesson → CTA
