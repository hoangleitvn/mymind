# Multi-Platform Publishing Strategy

## Overview

Strategy for writing in public across multiple platforms with clear separation between personal brand (Hoang Le) and company brand (INNOMIZE).

**Goals (in priority order):**
1. Thought leadership - Build reputation as engineering leader
2. Community building - Build audience for personal brand (BTL)
3. Lead generation - Attract clients for INNOMIZE (follows from 1 & 2)

**Time budget:** ~14-21 hours/week (2-3 hours/day)

**Team:** SDR + Marketing Specialist joining


## Platform Inventory

| Platform | Brand | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| LinkedIn (Personal) | Hoang Le | Active |
| BTL Substack | Hoang Le | Launching |
| Twitter | Hoang Le | Dormant |
| innomizetech.com | INNOMIZE | Active (Primary) |
| Dev.to (hoangleitvn) | Hoang Le | Active (300+ followers, 100k views) |
| LinkedIn Company Page | INNOMIZE | Active |
| GitHub | Both | Maintenance |

**Closed/Removed:**
- INNOMIZE Substack - Deleted (Dec 2024)
- Dev.to INNOMIZE - Not needed (use personal account instead)

**Domains:**
- buildsthatlast.com - Custom domain for BTL Substack
- btl.dev - Redirect to buildsthatlast.com (start simple)


## Platform Architecture

### Tier 1 - Primary (Your Time)

| Platform | Purpose | Frequency |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| innomizetech.com/blog | SEO, credibility, lead capture (publish first) | 2-3x/month |
| LinkedIn (Personal) | Distribution + engagement | Daily |
| BTL Substack | Thought leadership, owned audience | Weekly |

### Tier 2 - Secondary (Your Time, Lower Priority)

| Platform | Purpose | Frequency |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Dev.to (personal) | Discovery, promote BTL, overview articles | 1-2x/month |
| LinkedIn Company Page | Company content sharing | 2x/month |

### Tier 3 - Minimal/Optional

| Platform | Purpose | Frequency |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Twitter | Auto-syndicate key content | Minimal |
| GitHub | Credibility, not content focus | Maintenance |


## Content Architecture

### By Content Type

| Content Type | Platform | Voice | Who |
|--------------|----------|-------|-----|
| Leadership philosophy | BTL + LinkedIn | Personal | You |
| Engineering insights | BTL + LinkedIn | Personal | You |
| Quick takes/hot takes | LinkedIn posts | Personal | You |
| Technical deep-dives | Website (primary) | Company | You/Team |
| Technical overviews | Dev.to (personal) | Personal | You |
| Case studies (lessons) | BTL | Personal | You |
| Case studies (technical) | Website | Company | You/Team |
| Company updates | LinkedIn Company Page | Company | Team |

### Content Separation Principle

**Personal (Hoang Le):** Why, philosophy, leadership, lessons learned, technical overviews
**Company (INNOMIZE):** How, tutorials, technical implementation, detailed case studies

### Dev.to Strategy (Personal Account)

Dev.to serves as a **discovery channel** with existing audience (300+ followers, 100k views):

- Write **overview/summary articles** that link to detailed posts on website
- Example: "AWS re:Invent 2025: 3 Announcements That Matter" → links to 3 deep dives on innomizetech.com
- Include BTL Substack promotion in author bio
- NOT for republishing full articles (create unique value)


## Publishing Flows

### Personal Content - Thought Leadership (BTL)

```
Idea → BTL Substack (full essay)
         ↓
    LinkedIn (teaser post + link to BTL)
         ↓
    3-5 atomic LinkedIn posts (key insights from essay)
         ↓
    Twitter (optional auto-syndicate)
```

**BTL vs LinkedIn Articles:**
- Regular essays: BTL exclusive + LinkedIn teaser (builds email list)
- Cornerstone pieces: Full publish on both (maximum reach)
- Ratio: 80% exclusive / 20% dual-publish

### Technical Content - Website First

```
Write → innomizetech.com/blog (primary, SEO, publish FIRST)
           ↓ (wait 24-48h for Google indexing)
        LinkedIn Company Page (share with summary)
           ↓
        You share on personal LinkedIn (with commentary)
           ↓
        Dev.to (personal) - write overview article linking back
```

**Important:** Always publish on website first for SEO. Dev.to gets overview/summary articles that drive traffic back, NOT full republished content.

### Dev.to Overview Article Pattern

When you have 2-3 related articles on website:
1. Write a combined overview article for Dev.to
2. Summarize key insights from each
3. Link to full articles on innomizetech.com
4. Include BTL Substack CTA in bio/footer

Example: "AWS re:Invent 2025: 3 Announcements That Matter for Your Architecture"
- Brief summary of EKS, Lambda, RDS changes
- Key takeaways
- Links to deep dives on website


## Weekly Time Allocation

| Activity | Hours | Frequency |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| BTL essay writing | 4-5h | 1x/week |
| LinkedIn posts | 3-4h | 3-5 posts/week |
| LinkedIn engagement | 3-4h | 30-45 min/day |
| INNOMIZE content oversight | 1-2h | Review + strategy |
| Research/ideation | 2-3h | Reading, noting |
| Scheduling/admin | 1h | Cross-posting |

**Total:** ~14-19 hours/week

### Priority Stack (If Time Constrained)

1. LinkedIn engagement (30 min/day) - compounds fastest
2. LinkedIn posts (3x/week) - visibility
3. BTL essay (weekly or bi-weekly) - depth
4. INNOMIZE review (1h/week) - delegate execution


## Team Delegation

### Marketing Specialist

- Write/edit blog posts for innomizetech.com
- Manage Dev.to syndication (canonical links, timing)
- Run LinkedIn Company Page
- Maintain content calendar
- Track content performance metrics

### SDR

- Engage on LinkedIn (company page interactions)
- Distribute content to prospects
- Track leads from content
- Identify content topics from prospect conversations

### You (Hoang)

- Write BTL essays
- Personal LinkedIn engagement + posts
- Review/approve company content
- Content strategy direction
- Thought leadership positioning


## Platform Decisions (December 2024)

### INNOMIZE Substack - DELETED

**Decision:** Fully deleted (not just archived)

**Rationale:**
- Website blog is better for SEO + lead capture
- Substack works best for personal brands (BTL)
- One less platform to manage
- Clean separation between personal and company

### Dev.to - Use Personal Account Only

**Decision:** Use hoangleitvn (personal) instead of INNOMIZE organization

**Rationale:**
- Personal account has 300+ followers, 100k views (existing audience)
- Can promote BTL Substack in bio
- More flexibility in content voice
- INNOMIZE org account would start from zero


## Domain Strategy

| Domain | Current Use | Recommended |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| buildsthatlast.com | Planned for BTL | Custom domain for BTL Substack |
| btl.dev | Undefined | Redirect to buildsthatlast.com |
| innomizetech.com | Company website | Add /blog section for content |

**Future option for btl.dev:** Short link service (btl.dev/aws-cost) for tracking shares and analytics.


## Twitter Strategy

**Current:** Dormant

**Recommendation:** Minimal syndication

- Auto-share key LinkedIn content via scheduling tool
- Engage 10-15 min when you have momentum
- Revisit in 6 months based on BTL subscriber growth
- Inconsistent presence hurts more than helps

**Decision point:** Re-evaluate Q2 2026 based on BTL growth.


## Avoiding Overlap

1. **Voice separation:** Personal (you) vs Company (team)
2. **Content types:** Philosophy on BTL, tutorials on INNOMIZE platforms
3. **Syndication not duplication:** One source, multiple distribution channels
4. **Calendar rhythm:** LinkedIn daily, BTL weekly, INNOMIZE bi-weekly


## Quarterly Cadence

| Quarter | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| Q1 2026 | Establish BTL + LinkedIn rhythm, onboard team |
| Q2 2026 | Scale team content, evaluate Twitter activation |
| Q3 2026 | Optimize based on metrics, expand what works |
| Q4 2026 | Review, plan next year |


## Success Metrics

### Personal Brand

- BTL subscribers (target: track growth rate)
- LinkedIn followers
- LinkedIn post impressions
- Profile views from target audience

### Company Brand

- Website blog traffic
- Dev.to article views
- Leads from content (track source)
- LinkedIn Company Page engagement


## Open Questions

1. Content calendar tool - What will team use to coordinate?
2. Analytics - What tools for tracking cross-platform performance?
3. BTL Substack custom domain - buildsthatlast.com setup status?


## Next Steps

2. [x] Delete INNOMIZE Substack - DONE (Dec 2024)
3. [x] Publish AWS re:Invent articles on website - DONE (3 articles)
