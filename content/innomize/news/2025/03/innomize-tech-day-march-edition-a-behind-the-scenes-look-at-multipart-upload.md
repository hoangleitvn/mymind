# [INNOMIZE TECH DAY – March Edition] A Behind-the-Scenes Look at Multipart Upload

This month, our INNOMIZE team enjoyed a super insightful Tech Day session with the topic: **“Multipart Upload – Behind the Scenes”**, hosted by our **Tech Lead – Hiep Dinh**.

During the talk, Hiep walked us through how large files are efficiently uploaded – not just a simple drag-and-drop, but a fully optimized process happening behind the scenes.

### Some key highlights from the session:

- Getting to know Multipart Upload – breaking large files into smaller parts for parallel uploading, improving speed and stability.

- A deep dive into the full workflow: file splitting, part uploads, tracking, and final merging.

- Real-world use cases in cloud storage, media streaming, big data, and more.

- Tips and technical considerations for performance, error handling, security, and monitoring.

The session sparked lots of great discussions, real-life examples, and valuable insights from our teammates.

Big thanks to Hiep Dinh and everyone who joined in. Can’t wait for the next Tech Day! 🚀
