# INNOMIZE Open Day - Outsourcing 2.0 & Modern Engineering

In June 2025, **INNOMIZE** hosted an impactful **Open Day** centered on **“Outsourcing 2.0 & Modern Engineering.”** The session brought together our team to reflect on business updates, explore emerging tech trends, and align our engineering mindset with the future of AI-powered development.

### From Cost-Cutting to Co-Creation: The Rise of Outsourcing 2.0

The outsourcing game has changed. No longer just a cost-saving tactic, **Outsourcing 2.0** is about **innovation, efficiency, and strategic partnerships** — with AI at its core.

#### 🔍 Key shifts include:

- AI doesn’t replace humans — it empowers them (Human-in-the-loop collaboration).

- Up to 80% of repetitive work can be automated.

- AI enables smart task allocation, faster onboarding, and improved service delivery.

*👉 Outsourcing 2.0 = AI + Human Talent + Strategic Collaboration*

### Strategic Partnerships Over Vendor Contracts

At INNOMIZE, we’re shifting from being mere service providers to becoming strategic partners — shaping roadmaps, co-owning outcomes, and building trust-based long-term relationships.

#### ✨ Benefits for our teams:

- Greater influence on product direction.

- Flexible delivery, with a focus on value, not volume.

### Modern Engineering: Less Friction, More Impact

#### What We’re Embracing:
- ✅ Clear, intentional communication
