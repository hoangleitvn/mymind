If you cannot effectively communicate with your offshore team, then you will face the risk of your project failing, which ends up being a waste of time and money. Fortunately, there are numerous tools available to use, the question is determining which one is best for you and your teams. Read on as we relay the best platforms suitable for communicating with your offshore team with minimal to no issues.

## Best Communication Tools with Your Offshore Development Team

We understand the common communication issues you may have when managing your offshore development team. After all, the distance and differing time zones can make it difficult to find the perfect schedule or methods to update one another throughout the project. 

Not to worry, as today’s technology has made it even easier to reach out to manage your offshore team regardless of where they are in the world. Consider using any of these best communication tools with your offshore development team:

### **SLACK**

Slack is one of the top project management tools if you’re looking for something made for daily conversations. With this platform, you can send direct messages, documents, images, and other files to your team members. You can also make calls for regular meetings.

What makes Slack a suitable choice is that you can set up separate channels for each project or smaller groups. That way, your messages, calls, or files can either go to the entire team, to a certain group, or to individuals. 

### **MICROSOFT TEAMS**

Next up is Microsoft Teams, an excellent communication tool that offers instant messaging, video conferencing, audio calls, and file-sharing features. You can opt for group chats for up to 10,000 people, making it suitable for small and large companies alike. 

Besides this, the tool also offers real-time file creation and sharing of Microsoft files like Word, Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint. You can even integrate Microsoft Teams with project management apps like Monday.com.

### **ZOOM**

Many of you may already know Zoom, using it at work, school, or with loved ones at the height of the pandemic. This is one of the most popular online communication platforms for conducting conferences, seminars, workshops, and meetings. With Zoom, you can facilitate real-time communication and file-sharing among your team members who join the call.

But what makes Zoom unique is its simplicity and scalability. You can depend on it for almost anything, may it be a virtual meeting or a training session. Because of this, it’s one of the top tools you must have when managing remote teams. Thanks to its real-time messaging features, you can easily coordinate dispersed teams, keeping everyone on the same page.

A huge plus is Zoom’s screen-sharing features, which are crucial when presenting your brand guidelines or allowing offshore teams to share their progress.

### **TRELLO**

You’re probably already familiar with Trello, just as people are with Zoom. After all, it’s one of the best communication tools with your offshore development team out there!

This platform allows teams to list and delegate tasks, with the ability to create boards with task cards that are easy to understand. The entire team will know the tasks to do and what has been completed, what’s currently being worked on, and the project timelines. 

This feature is extremely important for software developers, as every task must be sequenced. Trello helps with that, keeping everyone in sync.

Besides this, you can use Trello to manage your tasks and create cards for actions that must be accomplished to keep the project moving. For instance, you can add tasks to do like providing feedback on the recent project update, sending out brand guidelines, and the like. The platform will keep you organized while also keeping your offshore team working in harmony. 

### **GOOGLE DRIVE**

If you’re looking for a reliable platform where you can store and share a large amount of files to access on your computer, smartphone, or tablet, then Google Drive is the way to go.

This platform isn’t focused on communicating with your offshore team via messaging or calls, but you’ll be able to store legal documents and large files like images, designs, recordings, and videos. This is beneficial for businesses and remote teams as they can have access to files or documents no matter the time or place. 

### **GITHUB**

 ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/innomizetech/image/upload/v1709009130/production/Git_Hub_logo_3c818b11ef.png) 

GitHub is a popular service among developers as it allows them to store, share, and collaborate on source code files. While it’s an open-source platform, you can opt for storing private projects for a minimal fee, compared to Bitbucket, a similar platform that charges per user. 

Besides this, GitHub also syncs with automated testing tools like Jenkins, allowing developers to write and check their code at the same time.

### **BASECAMP**

Basecamp is a fantastic tool that allows for smoother collaboration among team members working in different locations. Other than communicating or messaging your team, you can use Basecamp to assign tasks, automate weekly reports, and share documents.

Basecamp is also one of the most reliable platforms, having been in business for over two decades and with over 100,000 companies using it for their projects. As a project manager, you will have a better idea of the project’s progress and also manage your remote team better. From here, you’ll be able to delegate tasks, set strict deadlines, review current statuses and tasks, as well as evaluate pending tasks. 

### **FLOCK**

Flock is another popular and useful messaging system you can consider using as your main line of communication. It’s a messaging and team collaboration app similar to Slack, though you can use this alongside other tools like Asana to communicate with your offshore team and stay connected no matter where everyone is in the world or what project they are currently working on.

You can also take advantage of Flock’s numerous features, including cloud-based file transfer and storage, cloud messaging, and a user-friendly interface. 

### **MIRO**

Miro is a collaborative whiteboard software suitable for mind mapping and brainstorming sessions. It has an intuitive whiteboard that allows you to visually present ideas, facilitate meetings, create organizational charts, and communicate online or offline. Similar to Zoom, you can conduct interactive presentations and take advantage of the chat feature while on call.

### **SKYPE**

You’ve probably already heard of Skype, a popular messaging app where online communication is made much easier. Through this platform, you can send messages via chat or schedule audio and video calls in a snap. 

Whether you want to conference with a team member or the entire team, you’ll be able to manage your remote team without issues.
