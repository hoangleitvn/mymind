Healthcare IT outsourcing is a popular business model that has piqued the interest of leading health enterprises, with the dominant region being North America. The majority of the IT outsourcing market in North America comes from the USA, likely because of the country’s higher adoption of digital healthcare. 

The business model will continue increasing its market share in the future thanks to how well-established it is in the healthcare industry, but we will be getting into that in the next section.

### Healthcare IT Outsourcing Market

While healthcare IT outsourcing was already evolving quickly before 2020, the pandemic accelerated it further, as businesses shifted to a work-from-home or remote work setup. Today, the global healthcare IT outsourcing industry will likely reach a whopping 390.7 billion USD in 2024.

This number is predicted to grow by 2028, with experts expecting an increase by a compounded annual growth rate of 6.4%, and with an expected growth rate of 11.5% through 2029. 

This number may sound like an over-exaggeration, but it’s backed by solid reasons. This is because healthcare organizations are now being held to new standards with cutting-edge technologies that require new services in the IT field. 

Moreover, while the healthcare market is undergoing a technological change, even basic IT tasks including data storage, network management, data security, and service desk services are outsourced to save time and money. With the ease of performing tasks from different parts of the world, more companies and executives are shifting towards the outsourcing market to get IT tasks done efficiently. 

Here are more things one can expect from the healthcare IT outsourcing market:

#### 1. A Healthy Growth to Come

The payer’s healthcare IT outsourcing market is expected to grow over the forecast period, thanks to the changes made in the healthcare landscape. Due to regulatory amendments and rising costs, many healthcare organizations are adopting new technologies and outsourcing business models to cut costs without scrimping on quality.

At the moment, large companies are partnering up with large business process outsourcing (BPO) companies, along with knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) companies for IT services, including healthcare IT operations. 

Thanks to the cost savings and improved efficiency of outsourcing, many healthcare organizations are outsourcing to BPOs and IT partners, availing of services such as integrated cloud-based platforms. This goes especially for healthcare insurance payers, which are streamlining processes through outsourcing, which reduces costs while providing quality patient care. 

#### 2. North America Dominates The Market

At the moment, North America is dominating the healthcare IT outsourcing market, and it’s expected to continue its stronghold. North America is expected to increase its market share in the long run, thanks to a well-established healthcare industry and reimbursement systems. As expected, the United States holds the majority of the market in North America, as they have a higher adoption of digital healthcare, along with their rising investments from companies in the country. 

In the United States, the healthcare IT outsourcing market is expected to grow significantly because of the increase in investments by major companies, along with growth strategies launched by market players, including acquisitions and mergers. 

One particular IT service that the market will see growth in is the development and delivery of cloud-based health IT solutions. Doing so offers various benefits, including ease of use, improved patient experience, organizational effectiveness, and more. Because of these, key market players will work to provide advanced IT outsourcing services for the healthcare industry, which contributes to the market’s growth.

#### 3. Industry Overview

Healthcare providers can outsource various technologies to IT partners, such as:

#### 1. Electronic Health Record Systems

Organizations can outsource the implementation and management of Electronic Health Record systems, allowing providers to digitize and centralize their patient medical records. 

A reputable IT partner will take care of customizing, integrating, maintaining, and updating the EHR platform, thus streamlining clinical workflow and patient data management. 

#### 2. Medical Billing and Coding Software

Healthcare organizations will be able to outsource medical billing and coding processes to IT partners specializing in these services. Doing so will help organizations greatly reduce billing errors, as well as ensure timely reimbursement. 

Organizations can even avail of cloud-based medical billing services, which automate billing procedures and improve revenue cycle management. 

#### 3. Telemedicine and Remote Patient Monitoring Solutions

Outsourcing telemedicine and remote patient monitoring solutions helps healthcare providers monitor patients and give virtual consultations easily. This is an important service to avail of when treating patients with chronic conditions or those who live in remote areas. 

#### 4. IT Infrastructure Management

Healthcare providers can rely on a reputable IT partner to manage their IT infrastructure, such as hardware, networks, and servers, to ensure smooth operations and better data accessibility. An IT partner can design, deploy, and maintain IT infrastructure for healthcare facilities, lessening the need to hire an in-house department. 

#### 5. Cybersecurity Services

Outsourcing cybersecurity and data protection services is an essential practice to protect sensitive patient information, as well as to comply with regulatory standards such as HIPAA.

Various IT partners and outsourcing providers offer such services, which include advanced threat detection, security audits, and encryption to mitigate any risks and maintain data confidentiality within healthcare organizations.

### Challenges Related to the IT Healthcare Market

The healthcare IT outsourcing market, despite its growth, continues to face a few challenges, including:

#### 1. Lack of Skilled Professionals

The need for skilled professionals is a significant challenge for the market, making it difficult for healthcare organizations to find the right companies to outsource IT services to. 

Other than the lack of skilled professionals, there may also be a negative impact on staff, who may have concerns about their job security, loss of internal control, and any collaboration challenges. Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate such challenges, including careful planning and effective communication with staff and the outsourced team. 

#### 2. Security Risks

Security risks are another major challenge, as healthcare organizations store a lot of sensitive data. Because of this, outsourcing can introduce potential security and privacy risks, along with the risk of unauthorized data access with improperly implemented procedures. 

As such, IT partners will need to take extra precautions to protect such data from unauthorized access. 

#### 3. Compliance Issues

The healthcare industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries, making compliance a challenge in the outsourcing market. Healthcare organizations will need to comply with various regulations, so they will need to make sure their IT partners are just as compliant. 

With all these challenges mentioned above, there are market opportunities and recommendations that can be followed, starting with partnering with the right IT partner and implementing appropriate security measures. 

### The Role of Outsourcing in Healthcare Digital Transformation

All the information above may lead you to wonder about the role of outsourcing in healthcare digital transformation. Here are some of the ways outsourcing has helped:

#### 1. Adoption of Electronic Health Records

Patient data is confidential and usually unstructured, making it a challenge to incorporate such information into the healthcare delivery process. However, it must be done to help improve patient-centered care in the long run. 

While Electronic Health Records have been used for over a decade now, today’s market is quickly accelerating because of government initiatives all over the world in a move to improve patient data security.

Regulatory requirements are spurring the adoption of Electronic Health Records and the increasing number of Responsible Care Organizations.

This is where outsourcing IT services come along, which help integrate end-users throughout the healthcare system, including pharmacies, nursing units, hospitals, and health insurance companies. It’s become a popular solution among healthcare providers because of the importance of real-time data integration, ensuring effective decision-making among healthcare professionals.

With the anticipated growth of EHR, healthcare providers will start focusing on enhancing their systems with EHR, creating more custom healthcare software development opportunities for IT outsourcing providers specializing in the healthcare industry. 

#### 2. Growing Demand for Remote Patient Monitoring Solutions

Currently, there is a growing demand for telehealth services for monitoring and consulting purposes. Fortunately, there are technological advancements in healthcare solutions that help deliver educational content while ensuring smoother communication between healthcare providers and patients.

That said, the success of remote patient monitoring solutions will depend on the Information and Communication Technology devices used, which an IT partner can provide. Since healthcare professionals usually spend their time working away from a computer in hospitals, it’s a challenge to gain access to patient records while on the go. This is why IT partners are offering different solutions, such as mobile apps as a healthcare IT solution.

#### 3. Technological Advancements
The IT healthcare industry is constantly evolving, especially with the emergence of advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, blockchain, telemedicine, and the like. IT outsourcing allows healthcare providers to utilize such technologies without the hassle of dealing with continuous technology upgrades and skill development.

When entrusting such tasks to an IT partner, the organization stays competitive, continuing to deliver the best care possible.

#### 4. Data Security
In the healthcare industry, it’s crucial to protect sensitive patient data, which an IT outsourcing provider can accomplish. You’ll find various IT outsourcing companies that specialize in cybersecurity and data protection. 

When you entrust critical tasks to experienced IT partners, organizations will experience better data security measures. This will then protect vital patient information from potential breaches or cyber threats, which are becoming a growing issue in today’s technological world.

#### 5. Regulatory Compliance
As we all know, healthcare is a heavily regulated industry no matter where you are in the world. There are strict data protection laws put in place, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

By outsourcing IT services to a company knowledgeable in healthcare regulations, organizations will be able to maintain compliance and security standards, which greatly reduces the risk of facing hefty penalties.

### Why Is Healthcare IT Outsourcing in High Demand?

There are a handful of reasons that drive innovation and the high demand for healthcare IT outsourcing, including:

#### 1. Technological Complexity

The healthcare industry, just like many other industries, has witnessed advancements in digital technologies, which have led to complex IT infrastructures and systems to manage. However, this task is easier said than done, as it requires specialized skills and knowledge, which not many organizations have in-house employees for.

As such, they will turn to IT partners who possess the necessary skills to navigate the technological complexities of today’s healthcare IT. 

#### 2. Cost Optimization

Healthcare providers are constantly pressured to reduce operational costs while maintaining high-quality services and patient-centered care. This is where outsourcing IT functions come along, which can help with cost optimization as it reduces the need to hire or maintain an in-house IT department. It also reduces the need to manage and invest in specialized hardware and software.

A reputable IT partner can provide the necessary services at lower costs compared to maintaining an in-house IT department, thanks to shared resources and economies of scale. Besides this, outsourcing IT services reduces the need for a new workspace, which also saves organizations time and resources.

#### 3. Core Competencies

Healthcare organizations strive to provide quality patient care to improve medical outcomes. When outsourcing IT tasks to a trusted IT outsourcing provider, healthcare providers will have more time and resources to focus on their core competencies without having to deal with issues and responsibilities related to IT management and support.

#### 4. Access to Specialized Skills
Many experienced IT partners possess a team of skilled professionals and top talents with specialized expertise in healthcare IT. Their team members work to stay updated with the latest technologies, industry best practices, and regulations, besides engaging in continuous learning in the IT industry.

When you partner with such outsourcing providers, healthcare organizations will have access to a specialized talent pool and resources. This allows organizations to utilize advanced technologies and solutions to improve overall operations.

#### 5. Flexibility and Scalability
There are times when healthcare organizations will experience fluctuations in IT demands due to different factors, including seasonal variations, technological advancements, patient volumes, and the like.

With the right IT partner, healthcare professionals can take advantage of their scalability, with the ability to adjust IT resources based on one’s needs. The flexibility is a huge benefit to healthcare providers, who won’t have trouble adapting to the dynamic marketing conditions and potential challenges.

### Choosing a Healthcare IT Outsourcing Provider

Now that you know more about the current healthcare IT outsourcing market and its benefits, the next question is how to choose the right IT partner. Here are a few tips and factors to consider:

#### 1. Customer Feedback

Just like selecting a product or service, you must look up customer feedback. Evaluate potential candidates by examining their portfolios, client testimonials, and business models. This will show the IT partner’s performance and whether they can deliver the results you need.

Other than reading up on customer feedback. You can also ask for references and recommendations from healthcare organizations that have hired your chosen IT outsourcing partner. Gaining insights from similar organizations can give you a better perspective on the IT partner’s performance and reliability.

#### 2. Expertise and Experience

Before anything else, you must evaluate the IT partner’s track record and expertise in the healthcare domain. Hire an outsourcing company with a proven history of successfully delivering healthcare IT solutions, as this ensures they have a deep understanding of the industry’s nuances and regulatory requirements.

#### 3. Compatibility and Work Culture

Of course, it isn’t just about finding an IT partner with the knowledge and expertise. You’ll want them to also be an almost-perfect fit with your company’s culture. Your chosen IT partner should have proper cultural compatibility with your company, possessing a shared commitment to patient care and great collaboration. With great compatibility comes increased productivity and a positive working relationship that will bring your company to success.

#### 4. Scalability and Flexibility

Check the IT partner’s ability to accommodate your company’s IT needs. It’s important to find an IT partner who can provide scalable solutions, allowing your tech infrastructure to grow according to the services you offer.

#### 5. Security and Compliance

You must always prioritize security and compliance when it comes to choosing an IT partner. Your chosen outsourcing provider must be well-versed in healthcare regulations, including HIPAA. That way, you can rest assured that all sensitive information is safeguarded and confidentiality is upheld. This will reduce risk and maintain trust among stakeholders and clients. 

#### 6. Technological Proficiency

Evaluate your chosen IT partner’s proficiency with relevant and necessary technologies. In the case of healthcare, your chosen IT partner needs to be proficient with telemedicine platforms, EHR systems, cybersecurity measures, and the like. Having a technologically proficient IT partner will ensure advanced solutions are implemented, well-managed, and made for your healthcare settings.

#### 7. Find a Partner

You’re looking for an IT partner and not just a vendor. This is a common mistake many companies make, as they end up looking for a vendor just to provide a service, rather than a company they can partner with for the long-term. 

Your chosen IT partner should not only have the expertise, knowledge, and communication skills, but also the willingness to cooperate and partner with your organization to overcome challenges easily. They should also be willing to provide full transparency, whether it’s suggesting strategies or discussing solutions to current issues. 

#### 8. Communication and Support

Look into the IT partner’s communication channels and support mechanisms. You’ll want a partner who offers excellent communication skills and will be able to update you on project progress regularly.

It’s important to hire an IT partner who offers clear and responsive communication, which will then ensure better collaboration and resolutions to any issues that appear. As a result, you can prepare for any “surprises” that come your way, as well as align the outsourcing expenses with your budget. 

#### 9. Cost-Efficiency

Speaking of budget, you must also consider how much outsourcing will cost in the first place. It’s best to receive a transparent pricing model and to discuss the breakdown of costs, which will also help avoid any surprises and hidden expenses that will break your budget.
