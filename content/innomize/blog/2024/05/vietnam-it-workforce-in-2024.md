Vietnam's education system is increasingly aligned with the demands of the IT industry. Universities and technical colleges have expanded their curricula to include more IT-related courses, ranging from software development to cybersecurity. Partnerships between educational institutions and tech companies are common, offering students hands-on experience and job placements upon graduation.

Moreover, coding bootcamps and online courses have become popular, providing flexible learning options for aspiring IT professionals. This trend has contributed to a steady supply of skilled workers ready to meet the evolving needs of the tech industry.
