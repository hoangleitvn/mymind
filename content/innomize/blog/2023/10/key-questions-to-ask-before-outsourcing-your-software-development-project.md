# Key Questions to Ask Before Outsourcing Your Software Development Project

There are numerous reasons companies are looking into hiring an IT partner. Not only are they cost-effective, but software development outsourcing companies will allow you to receive versatility and efficiency from a well-rounded team working exclusively toward your goals.
Read on to find out what questions you should ask before outsourcing your software development project.

You can only reap the benefits of outsourcing when you select the best one. This will mean conducting research and interviews to determine whether they are the right fit for your business.

One of the risks of outsourcing is receiving subpar work or constant delays in your software development project due to unproficient software development outsourcing companies. To prevent that from happening, it’s recommended to have a deep discussion with your top chosen IT partners and ask them the following questions:

### **1. Have you worked on projects similar to mine or within the same industry?**

Your team must ask this question to understand if the potential IT partner has had prior experience with a similar project or industry. You will also learn about the types of companies the IT partner has cooperated with, as well as the services they provide in a specific domain. 

This question is also an opening to learn about the IT partner’s expertise and how long they have been operating. 

When outsourcing your software development project, you will want a tech partner with years of relevant expertise, along with a well-trained team who meets your core values and knows how to handle the scope of work you need done. As such, learning about the outsourcing company’s experience will help you know if they are capable of delivering your project successfully.

### **2. What does your company’s development process look like?**

When you prepare to outsource software development, you need to know how the IT partner’s process is organized, as this influences your collaboration. This question should answer things like:

- Do you conduct regular team meetings or follow scrum?

- How does the offshore team divide tasks and what steps are involved throughout the development process?
- What are your working hours?
- What’s your unique hiring process and how long do you need to scale up?

Knowing how your chosen IT partner works will help you set expectations when it comes to communication.

### **3. How will you communicate with me during the process?**

Clear communication is key to successful projects. You wouldn’t want to be left uninformed about your project’s current progress. Besides that, it’s best to partner with a software development company that matches your communication style.

Learn about how often you will communicate with the team and the tools used when doing so. If you’re unfamiliar with the communication software they use, you can suggest using what you’re familiar with and see if they can easily adapt to your preferences.

The one thing to watch out for is a partner that communicates through a third party, especially when they aren’t directly involved in your project. This can result in misunderstandings and a lot of back and forth that wastes more time.

### **4. Can you provide testimonials and portfolios from previous clients?**

Other than listening to the IT partner talk about their experience and past projects, you’ll want to see it to believe it. Ask if they can provide a portfolio from previous clients and if you can contact their clients directly to discuss their experience with the IT partner. 

Doing this will give you an idea of how the company works based on experience and not only through their official website claims.

### **5. How many people will be part of my team for this project?**

You must know how many team members the IT partner plans to provide for your project, as well as how much time they need to scale it up. This will give you clear expectations of who’s working on your project and also have you submit your request for more developers in case you need to expand your velocity.

Besides asking how many people will work on your project, you should also know if the assigned developers will remain the same throughout and if they are located within the same office. These factors can ensure a better workflow, which ultimately impacts your project outcome.  

### **6. How long will this project take until completion?**

The project's timeline is another important factor to look into as you will want things done efficiently without compromising quality. Determine when you need the project to be delivered and discuss whether or not the deadline is feasible, or if there’s room for adjustment.

Some software development companies can deliver your product quicker but at slightly higher prices, so you’ll want to take this into consideration. That said, higher prices don’t always mean better development, so their rates will be another factor to think of.

Beyond learning how long it can take to complete a project, determine how the IT partner estimates timelines. You’ll want to choose a company that’s transparent about their timeline estimation methodology, which will help you keep track of the project’s progress and set achievable goals. 

However, it’s important to note that estimating a project’s timeline is usually uncertain, but it becomes more accurate throughout the development process. The estimated project timeline only serves as a guide to setting expectations in terms of costs and workflow. 

### **7. How involved will I be in the project?**

Even if you are a non-technical client, it’s important to be involved in the software development process. Being involved in your project allows you to see its progress or make changes wherever needed while your product is still in the development stage.

As such, it’s crucial to discuss their view on how involved you will be and find a common ground that works best for both sides. This is also where communication comes into play, so you may want to follow up with more queries on their communication style throughout the process.

### **8. What are the security measures you have in place?**

You will likely share confidential information with your chosen IT partner, making privacy and security a priority. Inquire about how they plan to protect and preserve your data, as well as their recovery plan in case of a security breach or data loss. 

Also, check if the IT partner uses cloud storage solutions and sign an NDA before the start of any project. 

### **9. Can you provide a cost breakdown or estimation?**

Partnering with a software development company is a significant investment and you want to make sure you’re getting your money’s worth. That’s why it’s best to establish the cost breakdown to be aware of what you’re paying for and minimize the risk of overpaying or going past the agreed budget.

Your chosen IT partner and you should be on the same page in terms of budget. After discussing your project, ask what their possible strategy will be and how much it can cost. It will open up the conversation on what can be done to keep things within a reasonable budget without negatively affecting the project outcome.

### **10. What happens if I’m not satisfied with the project outcome?**

When outsourcing your software development project, there are times when clients will not be satisfied with the outcome. It doesn’t happen often, but it’s always important to know about the steps an IT partner will take in case things don’t go as expected. 

Your potential IT partner should discuss how they will ensure high-quality outcomes, and even offer a satisfaction guarantee.

## Conclusion

When you prepare to outsource software development, you shouldn’t forget to ask fundamental questions to ensure they are on the same wavelength as you are. Getting to know the company you plan to hire allows you to make an informed decision on who to hire based on crucial factors like expertise, budget, project timeline, and more.
