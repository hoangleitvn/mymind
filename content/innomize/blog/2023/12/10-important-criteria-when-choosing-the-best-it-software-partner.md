# 10 Important Criteria When Choosing the Best IT Software Partner

Finding the best IT software partner is crucial for successful projects. However, to find a company with the expertise and experience you need to meet expectations is easier said than done. 

If you want to stay ahead of the competition (which is every company’s goal), you must invest the time, money, and effort to connect with a software development partner that addresses your requirements. The question is - How will you know who to collaborate with?

It feels overwhelming to sift through the many available IT partners from your area to other parts of the world. As such, we help with the selection process by relaying crucial criteria to consider during your search for an IT software partner.

## Criteria to Choose the Best IT Software Partner

There are thousands of software development vendors that continue to promise top-quality solutions. That said, not all companies are equal and if you aren’t careful, you can end up with a partner who won’t deliver the results you expect. 

As a result, you may end up spending more time and money fixing issues that the wrong IT partner caused. To avoid such risks, here are the criteria to remember when selecting the best IT software partner:

### **Adequate Experience**

One of the top criteria when selecting the best IT software partner is experience. You want to make sure your chosen partner can handle your entire project from start to end of the development cycle.

A reliable partner should have the years of experience to drive a project forward, allowing you to be involved as much as you want. When they have experience with product discovery, prototyping, and business analysis, you won’t have to worry about preventable issues popping up. 

Rather, you can trust your vendor to deliver the results you want, taking the weight off your shoulders.

### **Great Technical Expertise**

Companies must find an IT partner that specializes in a specific domain and technology stack that fits their industry. Learn about the company’s technical expertise and if it fits the technical gaps you’re currently experiencing. 

The right tech partner can facilitate your products with smart and advanced features, as well as the domain knowledge to handle such tasks. If you have specific skill sets you’re looking for, you can shortlist vendors who have a proven track record in that particular area.

### **Strong Portfolio and Industry Recognition**
Before beginning a long-term partnership with an IT partner, how can you know if they have adequate experience and expertise?

It all begins with their portfolio, which gives you an idea if the IT partner has hands-on experience in similar projects as yours. This will also show you the different solutions they have worked on before, along with the types of products they usually develop. 

Other than a strong portfolio, you’ll also want to look after the IT partner’s overall reputation. While this can be done through checking the company’s portfolio and customer testimonials, a quick Google search will help you find out if a software development company is listed under respectable ratings, including:

- [Clutch](https://clutch.co/)
- [GoodFirm](https://www.goodfirms.co/)
- [Sortlist](https://www.sortlist.com/)

### **Company Size**

Another important criteria that various vendors tend to overlook is the size of the company and scale of its projects. Knowing the size of your IT partner will show you how flexible they are when you plan to scale the team up or down. 

Medium to large-sized vendors will have more internal resources, as well as a larger pool of candidates. This gives them more scalability, allowing them to extend their team to handle an increasing workload. Moreover, it allows the IT partner to rotate people to different projects if you plan on ramping down. 

### **Certifications and Partnerships**

Other than the IT partner’s tech stack, it’s also worth knowing the types of technologies, tools, and solutions they work with. You’ll want to ensure that what they use is suitable to deliver the necessary results.

To do so, look out for IT partners that have technology partnerships with reputable software companies. Being a certified partner with companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others will mean that the IT partner offers expertise recognized by industry leaders. The appropriate certifications will also add credibility to the company’s name, guaranteeing excellent service quality. 

### **Past Testimonials**

As mentioned, it’s crucial to find an IT partner that possesses a positive reputation, which you can look out for through client reviews and testimonials. You can check out review platforms online or ask for a reference to get a better idea of how the IT partner works.

Contact previous clients and ask if they can discuss their experience with the IT partner, tackling different aspects including their communication skills, the quality of their work, if the results helped achieve business goals, and the like. Don’t only look at the ratings of the software development company, but also what the clients have to say about them.

If you receive more negative reviews than positive ones, then it’s best to move on to a different vendor.

### **Engagement Models**

Beyond the cultural fit and quality of work an IT partner provides, it’s also important to look into your budget, as well as the methodology and engagement models offered. 

You can prevent going over budget by first understanding your project scope and final goal. This will then help you determine what engagement model you should avail of.

For example, if you only need IT services for a certain period, you wouldn’t want to employ a full-time IT partner member. It also won’t be financially wise to pay an IT partner an hourly rate if you plan for them to be completely involved in your project. That is why the Time and Materials engagement is suitable for shorter-term projects. 

If you already have a complete vision of your product, then the Fixed Price model works best. However, if you have a long-term project with ever-changing requirements, you will benefit more from a dedicated development team model. 

### **Communication**

Communication is the key to successful project management and collaboration. You’ll want to prevent issues such as dealing with low English proficiency, cultural differences, or partners who hardly communicate at all!

Rather, you will want an IT partner who will always send follow-ups and set meetings to talk about the progress of your project. They should also be easy to talk with and always ready to answer your queries, whatever they may be.

When meeting with the IT partner for the first time, whether virtually or physically, make sure you take a good look at how they communicate. It will help you see if there is good values alignment between your goals and their work ethics. Besides that, you will feel more assured that you’re working with a team that is transparent and ready to share any updates whenever they arise. 

### **Vendor Location**

Of course, the IT partner’s location is a crucial component of successful cooperation. 
Not only will this determine any time differences to take note of, but it will also determine the level of digital adoption and quality of talent available in the partner’s local market. You will also have to factor in the laws and regulations on outsourcing in that location, any cultural differences, and the business environment. 

While thinking about these aspects can be a bit of a hassle, they are worth the extra research as they prevent you from running into any costly issues.

### **Knowledge Transfer Plans**

Various aspects can make or break the success of knowledge transfer, including the product, processes used, and of course, the people. If an IT partner doesn’t understand what the product does, the way it operates, or who is responsible for specific tasks, then there will be trouble meeting expectations.

Because of this, it’s also important to discuss the knowledge transfer plans the IT partner provides. 

On the team level, the IT partner must establish knowledge-sharing sessions between team members. Whereas on the vendor level, your IT partner must make sure project knowledge is well-documented and easy to transfer to you or a new vendor, if necessary. Your IT partner must be able to handle the transition smoothly and on good terms.

Look into different factors such as:

- Sensitive data transition
- Information on source code ownership
- Non-disclosure agreement
- Partnership termination agreement
- Product Regulatory Compliance
