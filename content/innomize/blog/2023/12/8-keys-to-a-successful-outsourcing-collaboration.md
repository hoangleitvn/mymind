# 8 Keys to a Successful Outsourcing Collaboration

If you are outsourcing IT services, then you already know that one of the most essential components of achieving business growth is a meaningful partnership. That’s why it’s crucial to know about the keys to a successful outsourcing collaboration.

You might think that collaborating with your chosen IT partner isn’t a priority. Unfortunately, some companies tend to have this mindset where they merely hire a team for IT services and expect the best without considering proper communication and relationships. 

However, this shouldn’t be the case. Choosing the right IT outsourcing partner and cultivating a positive relationship with the outsourcing team involved can unlock business agility. Moreover, it can set your business up for success as you can receive the best service and results from the IT partner, which ramps up the return on investment.

Read on to learn more about what you can do for a successful outsourcing collaboration with every team you plan to work with.

You may be surprised to learn that the success of IT outsourcing doesn’t only depend on the partner you choose. It also relies on you! 

Research has shown that the IT outsourcing partner and client are equally responsible for the results, which makes it important to learn about the keys to a successful outsourcing collaboration. Make sure your IT outsourcing venture is successful with some of these key tips:

### **Define Your Goal**

Before you even begin hiring an IT partner, one of the most crucial keys to a successful outsourcing collaboration starts with you. Organizations tend to outsource IT services without completely understanding what they want to achieve with them. 

If you don’t understand your drivers and priorities, you won’t be able to find the right IT partner, much less have good collaboration and successful results. 

You can prevent this by defining your goals and knowing exactly why and what you are outsourcing, as well as how much you can spend while still achieving cost savings. When you define your goals and have a good understanding of them, the process of finding an IT partner becomes smoother. It will also be easier to discuss your expectations clearly, thus giving the IT partner more of an idea of what you need for a successful project.

Without much clarity on the project’s objectives, methodology, deadlines, and budget, you’re setting yourself and the IT partner up for failure. 

### **Communicate Your Expectations**

As mentioned, it’s important to communicate your goals and needs for success. Don’t expect the IT partner to automatically know what to do, you must learn how to openly communicate from the get-go.

Be honest about everything related to your business and the project from the start, including any business-related issues. Avoid concealing information, as this won’t get anything resolved. Rather, you must cooperate with your IT partner so they can find solutions to fix the problem without having to figure things out themselves once the problem has worsened.

Moreover, improper communication may lead to poorly discussed objectives, especially when you don’t meet regularly. Make sure you schedule regular meetings to stay updated about the project’s progress, so you can have your queries answered or resolve potential issues before they come up. 

Speaking of communicating your expectations, avoid setting unrealistic ones. While it’s important to set high expectations for your business and projects, they should also be reasonable and based on the skills and limits of your IT partner. 

To be able to set realistic expectations, you must have a complete grasp of the IT partner’s competence, which can be done during initial discussions of the project. From there, you’ll be able to determine the responsibilities, timetables, and deliverables you can expect. 

### **Appoint Decision-Makers**

If you have an in-house team, consider their experience and know-how. Are there areas where you may have issues with decision-making when building a product?
 
If you aren’t confident in your competencies, such as choosing the right technologies for your product, this is where your IT partner comes in. Appoint an IT partner who can be your decision maker and fill the gap by offering professional advice and making decisions that result in a successful partnership.
Once you have all the project details figured out and have an IT partner who has the skills and expertise to follow your directions, discussions are the next steps. During this process, make sure you keep an open mind and listen to the IT partner’s advice, if there is any extra feedback or suggestions they make. 

A competent IT partner will be able to look at your product from a new perspective, so you have more opportunities to learn more about how to improve the product or development project.

Remember, not everything you envision for your project will be feasible. Some parts can be unattainable due to factors like the economic downturn. In case your IT partner advises that something in the plan isn’t possible at the moment, don’t shut their ideas down. Ask them for a recommendation and what decisions they would make to help provide the best possible outcome.
 
Your IT partner will want the best for your company, as this is a reflection of the services’ quality they offer. Even if the final result differs from your initial idea, it might even be better than what’s expected!

### **Prepare for the Change**

Having a long-term partnership with a software development company will create change and even disrupt the organizational culture. Unfortunately, a lack of change management is a major reason why outsourcing partnerships fail.

Fortunately, this is a preventable problem. Prioritizing change management in both parties will help both partners work together effectively. It will make sure that complex changes are made efficiently, generate widespread support, and provide discipline to maintain progress. 

Moreover, change management will help people adapt to a new way of working, and that’s one of the important things to focus on. When preparing for change, do your best to maintain employee engagement and make sure that there aren’t any disruptions during the project’s implementation.

### **Be Aware of Time Zone Differences**

If you are outsourcing from a different country, there are various things to prepare for, such as any cultural differences and work methods. However, a notable thing to consider is the time zone, as this directly affects communication and project management.

You will want to communicate with your chosen IT partner regularly, so choose a partner with whom you have a time overlap of at least three hours a day. 

Besides this, it’s also worth setting up processes and communication tools, such as chatting on Slack over writing emails. Custom processes can help improve the way you both communicate, whether you are sending queries or your IT partner is providing updates on the project's progress.

### **Be Open to Compromise**

Trust is essential to maintaining an excellent business relationship. While you may want everything to go your way on the project, it’s also important to consider the advice of your IT partner in case they provide suggestions to improve the current procedure or work methods. 

Also, if your IT partner isn’t living up to your expectations, compromises may be in order. Of course, you must discuss your worries and provide feedback, but ultimately, you must also be prepared to make any adjustments and manage your expectations.

Again, communication is key. When your IT partner and yourself have an avenue to provide comments and recommendations, you can expect better procedures and results in the long run.

### **Do Not Micronage**

Remember that the IT partner you are outsourcing from has a team of experts who will bring a lot of value to your company. You wouldn’t want someone standing over you and managing everything you do, and your IT partner feels the same way. 

It’s important to oversee the project and its progress but allow the IT partner to handle the “how” part while you make sure they are delivering the agreed-upon expectations.

### **Have the Right Toolset**

We mentioned communication tools to help with outsourcing collaboration. But the question is, what types of communication and management tools should you employ?

There are many you can work with today, but the important thing to consider is to choose a tool both you and the IT partner are familiar with. Moreover, the support tools should meet the unique requirements of IT outsourcing, with features such as task-sharing, chat tools, video conferencing, and the like. 

Consider platforms such as Asana, Slack, or Trello, which are top tools that help businesses collaborate online and offline.
