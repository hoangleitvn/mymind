Noticed something in Claude Code v2.1.0.

Skills and commands now show up in the same list. Previously they were separate concepts - commands were built-in CLI actions, skills were extended capabilities.

Now they're displayed together.

Will they merge into one thing? Right now, I think maybe. The UI change hints at it, but the underlying behavior still differs.

Anyone else noticed this? Know what Anthropic's intent is here?

Curious if this is just a display change or a signal of where the architecture is heading.
