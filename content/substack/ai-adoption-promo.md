# AI Adoption Promo - Substack

## Subject Line Options

- The 4-step framework for AI adoption that actually works
- Why your AI tools aren't delivering (and how to fix it)
- AI adoption is a workflow decision, not a tool decision


## Post Content

Most organizations approach AI adoption backwards.

They buy tools first, then figure out use cases later. Six months in: quality complaints, trust erosion, and teams quietly abandoning the tools they fought to get.

I wrote about a framework we're developing and testing at INNOMIZE. The core insight:

**The tool is 20% of the outcome. The workflow is 80%.**

The pattern shows up everywhere:
- Marketing teams where AI drafts content but nobody reviews it (brand voice drifts)
- Finance teams where AI generates reports but nobody validates them (errors compound)
- Engineering teams where AI writes code but nobody can explain it (tech debt accelerates)

Same root cause: tools without workflow design create faster mistakes.

The framework:
1. Map the workflow before selecting tools
2. Build skills before scaling usage
3. Establish guardrails before pursuing speed
4. Select tools that fit the workflow

The article covers:
- Why tools-first fails (with industry examples)
- 5 human skills that matter more than tool selection
- Warning signs that adoption is going wrong
- A practical 4-week adoption plan

This comes from observation and first principles. We're applying it ourselves and documenting what holds up.

What failure modes are you seeing with AI adoption? Reply and let me know.

If this resonates with someone in your network, restack or save for later.
