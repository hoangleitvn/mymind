AI made building faster.

It also made skipping the thinking step faster.

Before AI, writing bad code took effort. You had to type it, debug it, ship it. The friction gave you time to reconsider.

Now you describe what you want and get working code in seconds. No pause. No friction. No moment where you stop and ask: should I even build this?

I keep seeing the same pattern.

Someone generates a feature in 20 minutes. Spends 2 weeks maintaining what they didn't need.

The build was free. The ownership wasn't.

AI doesn't remove the need for clarity. It raises the cost of skipping it. Because now you can go from "maybe we should..." to production code before anyone asks "wait, why?"

The best engineers I work with got slower in one specific way after adopting AI. They spend more time on the questions before the prompt. What problem. For whom. What's the simplest version.

The prompt is the easy part. Knowing what to prompt is the hard part.

What's the last thing you built with AI that you later realized you didn't need?
