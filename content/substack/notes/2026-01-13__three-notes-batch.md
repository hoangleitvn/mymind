## Note 1: The AI Knowledge Drain

The uncomfortable thing about working with AI:

Every private debugging session feeds a loop you can't see.

Stack Overflow used to be public knowledge. Developers shared problems, solutions became searchable, everyone benefited.

Now? You debug with AI. The solution stays in a company database. The next developer hits the same problem, asks AI, feeds the same loop.

Individually rational. Collectively harmful.

Game theory playing out in real time - and most developers don't realize they're playing.


## Note 2: AI Tool Selection is Habitual, Not Strategic

Asked one of our engineers why they use ChatGPT web instead of Copilot in their IDE.

They have both open. Right there.

They couldn't explain why.

Most teams have 3+ AI tools.
Few have criteria for when to use which.

Muscle memory wins over optimization.

If your team has multiple AI tools, ask: do they know which one to use for which task? Or are they just defaulting to habit?


## Note 3: Foundation Isn't Documentation

Foundation isn't documentation.

It's what you wish existed when you're stuck at 2am debugging production.

5 types of foundation every team needs:
- Speed: Fast execution without "wait, how do I..."
- Continuity: Knowledge that doesn't walk out the door
- Quality: Consistent output regardless of who's coding
- Decision: Autonomous action without constant escalation
- Recovery: Fast incident response without panic mode

Most teams have some of these.

The gaps show up as:
- Slow onboarding
- "Only Sarah knows how this works"
- Quality depending on who wrote it
- Every incident feeling like the first one

Which foundation is your weakest?
