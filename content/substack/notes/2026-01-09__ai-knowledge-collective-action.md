The uncomfortable thing about working with AI:

Every private debugging session feeds a loop you can't see.

Stack Overflow used to be public knowledge. Developers shared problems, solutions became searchable, everyone benefited.

Now? You debug with AI. The solution stays in a company database. The next developer hits the same problem, asks AI, feeds the same loop.

Individually rational. Collectively harmful.

Game theory playing out in real time - and most developers don't realize they're playing.

The question: does the pain get bad enough to shift behavior? Or is this just the new normal?
