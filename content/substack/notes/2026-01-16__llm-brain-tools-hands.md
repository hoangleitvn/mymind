Most upgrade the brain.
Few complete the body.

Agent is the whole person.
LLM is the brain.
Tools are hands.
Skills are specialized hands.
MCP is the handshake.

The brain reasons.
The hands execute.
Skills know specific crafts.
The agent coordinates it all.
MCP connects to the outside world.

Most upgrade the brain.
Few complete the body.

Most chase the latest model.
Few build and optimize their entire workflow.

Brains don't ship. Bodies do.
