2 minutes.

That's how long it takes to load your entire CMS into Claude Code.

I just pulled 126 blog posts from our company CMS with a simple script. Now Claude has full context on everything we've published.

Why this matters:

→ Repurpose old content without re-reading it
→ Maintain consistent voice across posts
→ Find patterns in what resonated
→ Generate new content grounded in your actual work

Your CMS isn't just storage. It's a knowledge base waiting to be activated.

If you're building content systems with AI, follow along. DM me if you want to see how this works.
