I started **[Builds That Last](https://buildsthatlast.substack.com/)**.

This is where I write about what actually makes software and teams last.

## Who This Is For

If you’ve inherited a system with no documentation and thought, *why did they build it this way*. I’m writing for you.

If you shipped fast and then spent months fixing what you shipped. I’m writing for you.

If you’re using AI tools and wondering why your team isn’t magically 10x more productive. I’m writing for you.

If you’re stepping into engineering leadership and realizing the job is very different from what you expected. I’m writing for you.

## What I Bring

I have 15 years of experience.  
I have patterns, failures, and lessons worth sharing.  
I have a system to capture, structure, and revisit what I learn.

Now I’m putting it out there.

I might not be good enough yet, but this is what I believe.  
**Strong foundations bring value.**

## The Iceberg Problem

What you see is the 20% above the water.  
Shiny demos. Fast shipping.  
“Everyone can build apps now.”  
Vibe coding. Agentic AI. Context engineering. Apps built in hours.

What you don’t see is the 80% below the surface.  
Maintenance. Technical debt.  
Systems stitched together that were never designed to work as one.  
Data inconsistencies compounding over years.  
Teams spending days just to understand what the previous developer was thinking.  
Edge cases and abnormal behaviors from external systems that quietly put everything at risk.

That 80% is where my teams and I spend most of our time.  
And that’s where the real lessons live.

People say, *build the 20% that matters*.  
But the trade-offs, risks, and long-term costs live in the other 80%.  
Almost nobody talks about that part.

## Why This Exists

This publication is for engineers becoming leaders.  
And for founders building technical teams they expect to last.

BTL isn’t just a publication. It’s a practice.

I’m not claiming to have all the answers.  
I’m building, learning, and sharing the journey as it unfolds.

If you’ve spent time dealing with the 80% below the waterline, I’d love to hear your stories in the comments.
