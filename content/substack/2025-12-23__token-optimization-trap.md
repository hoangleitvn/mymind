I tried to optimize my AI token usage.

So I wrote detailed instructions. Rules. Guardrails. The AI would follow them and be more efficient.

What actually happened: the AI used my instructions as context, then added more instructions on top. The instruction files grew. Token usage went up.

The optimization created the problem it tried to solve.

This is premature optimization applied to AI workflows. We're so worried about efficiency that we build complex systems to save tokens, then spend more tokens running those systems.

The fix is embarrassingly simple: write less. Prompt directly. Add instructions only when something actually breaks.

Stop optimizing for problems you don't have yet.
