# The Mountain Rain Test

You're on a mountain. Heavy rain starts. Do you go up or down?

Most people say: "Down. Get off the mountain."

Intuitive. But wrong?

Common survival advice says go UP. Flash floods collect in valleys. The path down becomes a river.

But here's what matters: **it depends.**

Near the peak? Up might be faster. Mid-mountain? Evaluate terrain, avoid landslide zones. Near the base? Keep going, avoid valleys. Your experience and gear? Changes everything.

The lesson isn't "always go up." It's: **don't follow intuition blindly. Think through consequences.**

This applies to decisions at work:

- Intuitive: Fix the bug in front of you.
- Better: Is this bug the most important thing right now?

- Intuitive: Ship this feature fast.
- Better: What breaks if we ship incomplete?

- Intuitive: Say yes to the client.
- Better: What are we saying no to by saying yes?

Good decisions aren't about finding the "right rule." They're about asking: what happens next?

Context changes everything. The answer that saves you today might kill you tomorrow.
