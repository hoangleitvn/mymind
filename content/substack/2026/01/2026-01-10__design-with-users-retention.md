Retention isn't about more features. It's about removing friction users didn't know they had.

Here's what's breaking in current design:

**1. Dead-end screens**
User completes a step. Screen goes blank. No next action. They leave.
→ Present the next logical action the moment they finish the current one.

**2. Static buttons are dead weight**
A button that sits there waiting is a missed opportunity.
→ Micro-interactions: buttons that respond, guide, and adapt to context.

**3. Sign-up walls before value**
Asking for email before showing what you do.
→ Guest mode first. Let users experience value. Sign-up becomes obvious.

**4. Edit flows that require navigation**
Click profile. Click settings. Click edit. Click save. Click back.
→ Inline editing. Click text, change it, done.

**5. Confirm dialogs everywhere**
"Are you sure?" for every action trains users to click without reading.
→ Undo over confirm. Let users act. Offer reversal.

**6. Empty states that stay empty**
First-time user sees blank dashboard. No guidance. No templates.
→ Smart defaults. Pre-populate with examples. Show what's possible.

**7. Help buried in docs**
User stuck. Help link goes to knowledge base. They search. They leave.
→ Contextual help. Surface answers where users get stuck.

**8. Forms that punish mistakes**
Fill 10 fields. Submit. Error on field 3. Start over.
→ Inline validation. Real-time feedback. Fix as you go.

**9. Loading that blocks**
Full-page spinner. User waits. User leaves.
→ Progressive loading. Show skeleton. Load content in pieces.

**10. Interfaces that forget**
User returns. State reset. Filters gone. Progress lost.
→ Remember state. Pick up where they left off.

The pattern: Stop designing interfaces. Start designing flows.

Users don't want features. They want to finish what they started.
