# Never Trust AI Blindly

**Never trust AI outputs blindly.**

I use AI tools daily. They speed up research, drafts, and code generation. But every output needs review.

Here's my rule: **Ask AI to explain its reasoning.**

When AI gives you an answer, follow up with "Why?" or "Walk me through your logic." Two things happen:

1. You catch hallucinations. AI makes up sources, invents facts, and confidently delivers nonsense. Asking for explanation exposes gaps.

2. You build understanding. Even when AI is correct, you need to know *why*. Copy-pasting without comprehension creates fragile work you can't defend or extend.

I've seen engineers ship AI-generated code without understanding it. When bugs appear, they're stuck. They can't debug what they never understood.

**The pattern:**
- Get AI output
- Ask: "Explain why this is correct"
- Verify the reasoning yourself
- Only then: use it

AI is a powerful tool. But tools don't replace thinking. They amplify it.

Trust your judgment. Question everything.
