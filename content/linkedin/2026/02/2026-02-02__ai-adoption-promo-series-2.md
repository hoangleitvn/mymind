AI will make your team 10x more productive.

No. It won't. Not at the beginning.

Addy Osmani said it best: 1.5-2x, not 10x.

And that 1.5-2x? Only shows up when skills are in place.

Same tool. Same training. Same prompt.
One team gets faster. Another gets slower.

The tool didn't change. The skills did.

Here are 5 skills that separate teams who gain from teams who struggle:

→ Problem Framing
Turn vague into testable.
"Make this better" = garbage.
"Reduce response time from 4h to 1h" = results.

→ Decomposition
Split work into verifiable steps.
"Write a quarterly report" is too big. AI guesses wrong.
Break it: gather → verify → analyze → verify → draft.

→ Evaluation
Know what good looks like before you see AI output.
Teams without this accept plausible-looking output.
Plausible is not correct. Plausible is verification debt.

→ Correction
Fix the 20%, don't regenerate.
Teams that regenerate instead of correct waste time and never improve.
Don't overuse AI. Debug AI output where you actually learn the pattern.

→ Systems Thinking
Make it easier next time.
Document what worked. Share what failed. Compound your learning as a team.

The teams that win don't chase 10x.

They invest in learning together:
↳ Define their systems clearly
↳ Build verification into the process
↳ Share what works and what doesn't
↳ Scale slowly after patterns emerge

1.5-2x sustained is a massive win.
10x promised, 0.5x delivered is a loss.

Workflow first. Skills second. Tools follow.

Which skill does your team need most?

> We're building these 5 skills across our teams before scaling AI usage. The order matters: workflow first, skills second, tools follow.

**Comment on Personal Post:**
> This mirrors what we're seeing internally. Teams that share learnings openly—what worked, what failed—compound faster than teams working in silos. The 5 skills can be taught, but the culture of sharing has to be built.
