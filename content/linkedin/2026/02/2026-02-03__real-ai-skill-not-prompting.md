Everyone's learning prompts.

That's the wrong skill.

I've watched teams invest weeks mastering prompt engineering. They get marginally better outputs.

Then I see someone with basic prompts deliver 10x results.

The difference?

They're better at the skills that come *before* and *after* the prompt:

→ **Problem framing** — Knowing what to ask before you ask it
→ **Decomposition** — Breaking complex work into AI-sized chunks
→ **Evaluation** — Recognizing when output is wrong (even when it sounds right)

These aren't AI skills. They're engineering skills.

Prompting is easy to teach. Judgment isn't.

The developers struggling with AI aren't struggling with syntax. They're struggling to evaluate outputs they don't fully understand.

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

If you can't verify what AI produces, you're not using it. You're trusting it.

And trust without verification is how technical debt compounds invisibly.

What skill is your team actually missing?
