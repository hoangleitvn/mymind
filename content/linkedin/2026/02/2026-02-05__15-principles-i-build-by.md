15 years building products. 50+ projects shipped, some failed, some succeed. These are the principles I keep coming back to.

On Clarity:
1. Build with clarity. 
↳  When clarity is present, teams move with confidence. When it's absent, speed creates waste.
2. Clarity over speed.
↳ Moving fast in the wrong direction compounds mistakes.
3. Build with intention. 
↳ Nothing should be added unless it supports the desired outcome.

On Structure:
4. Bias for structure.
↳ Structured systems scale. Unstructured systems collapse under pressure.
5. Optimize for change.
↳ Systems built for change stay relevant. Systems built for the moment decay quickly.
6. Simplicity as advantage.
↳ Simple systems ship faster, break less, and are easier to evolve.

On Context:
7. Decisions with context.
↳ Pre-PMF choices differ from post-PMF. There are no universal solutions.
8. Think in life-cycles.
↳ Some solutions are temporary bridges, others are long-term foundations.

On Outcomes:
9. Outcome over activity.
↳ Measure work by what it enables, not what it consumes.
10. Proof, not assumption.
↳ Build based on what is true, not what is feared.

On Teams:
11. Enable teams.
↳ Your job is to empower, not gatekeeper.
12. Remove cognitive load.
↳ Free teams to think about business logic, not unnecessary complexity.
13. Culture as infrastructure.
↳ Culture determines long-term velocity, quality, and resilience.

On Practice:
14. Document while building.
↳ A well-documented system scales beyond individuals.
15. AI as leverage.
↳ Use AI as a multiplier, not a substitute.

These aren't rules. They're defaults I return to when making hard decisions.

Which one resonates most with you?
