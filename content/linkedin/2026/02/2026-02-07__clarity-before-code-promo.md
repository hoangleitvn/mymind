10 questions before building anything.
30 minutes. Saves weeks.

Over 15 years I've watched teams build things nobody needed. Ship features that solved the wrong problem. Create systems nobody could maintain.

The building was fine. The thinking before building wasn't.

Here are the questions I've learned to ask:

SHOULD I BUILD AT ALL?

1. What problem am I solving?
→ Can't say it in one sentence? You don't understand it yet.

2. Who is this for?
→ "Everyone" means no one.

3. What happens if I don't build this?
→ Sometimes the answer is: nothing bad.

SHOULD I BUILD FROM SCRATCH?

4. What already exists that could work?
→ The best code is code you don't write.

5. Why did the reference choose this approach?
→ Copying outputs without understanding inputs is cargo culting.

WHAT'S THE RIGHT SCOPE?

6. What's the simplest version that solves the problem?
→ Build what must exist. Everything else can wait.

HOW DO I VALIDATE?

7. How will I know it works?
→ No success criteria means no way to improve.

8. What can break?
→ Think about failure before it finds you.

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I SHIP?

9. Who will maintain this after I'm done?
→ Building is easy. Owning is hard.

10. How will someone else understand this without me?
→ You won't be here forever. Leave breadcrumbs.

The first 5 decide if you should build at all.
The last 5 decide if what you build will last.

I wrote about each question in depth in this week's Builds That Last. Link in comments.
