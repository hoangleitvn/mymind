Everyone adopted AI in 2025.

Almost nobody won with it.

I spent the holidays reviewing McKinsey, Gartner, Stanford, and GitHub research to understand why.

The gap wasn't tools. It wasn't budget. It wasn't talent.

It was workflow redesign.

Here's what the data revealed:

→ 39% reported any financial impact from AI
→ Most saw less than 5% of EBIT attributable to AI
→ 57% admitted their data wasn't AI-ready
→ 62% experimented with agents, only 23% shipped one

The top 6% did something different:

They treated AI as an organizational transformation, not a technology deployment.

They asked what work should exist at all, not just how to do existing work faster.

They fixed data foundations before scaling AI usage.

They redesigned workflows around AI capabilities instead of bolting AI onto broken processes.

The uncomfortable truth:

> AI doesn't improve bad processes. It accelerates them.

2025 was the year we discovered which organizations knew how to make AI work and which ones were just checking boxes.

2026 is here. The experimentation phase is over.

Let's talk about what separates winners from the rest.

What matters now:
→ Workflow redesign before tool deployment
→ Data foundations before AI scaling
→ Measurable outcomes, not just faster outputs

The gap between leaders and followers won't narrow. It will widen.

What's your biggest lesson from AI adoption in 2025?

P.S. Follow for more on AI adoption, engineering leadership, and builds that last.
