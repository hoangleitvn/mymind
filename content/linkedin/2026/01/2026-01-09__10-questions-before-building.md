Before you build anything, ask these 10 questions.

Most problems aren't technical. They're clarity problems.

My team built a user guide using Google Sites this week.

When I asked why Google Sites, they said: "Product owner shared a reference and told us to do the same."

Same what exactly? Same tool? Same structure? Same approach?

They copied the output. They skipped the reasoning.

This happens everywhere. Code, docs, processes, tools.

Here are 10 questions that prevent wasted effort:

SHOULD I BUILD AT ALL?

1. What problem am I solving?
→ Building solutions looking for problems is expensive.

2. Who is this for?
→ "Everyone" means no one.

3. What happens if I don't build this?
→ Sometimes the answer is: nothing bad.

SHOULD I BUILD FROM SCRATCH?

4. What already exists that could work?
→ The best code is code you don't write.

5. Why did the reference choose this approach?
→ Copying outputs without understanding inputs is cargo culting.

WHAT'S THE RIGHT SCOPE?

6. What's the simplest version that solves the problem?
→ Start with minimum. Expand when you have evidence.

HOW DO I VALIDATE?

7. How will I know it works?
→ No success criteria means no way to improve.

8. What can break?
→ Think about failure before it finds you.

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I SHIP?

9. Who will maintain this after I'm done?
→ Building is easy. Owning is hard.

10. How will someone else understand this without me?
→ You won't be here forever. Leave breadcrumbs.

The first 5 questions decide if you should build at all.

The last 5 decide if what you build will last.

Most teams skip straight to "how"

The best teams start with "why" and "whether"

Next time someone says "do it the same way" ask them: same what?
