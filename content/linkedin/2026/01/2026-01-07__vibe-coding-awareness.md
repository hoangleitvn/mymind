Vibe coding isn't the problem.
Vibe coding without awareness is.

The tool is just a tool. It has no guilt.

AI won't replace engineers.

But engineers who ignore these tools will fall behind. And engineers who use them without understanding what they're shipping will accumulate debt they can't pay back.

Speed without understanding is borrowed time.
Speed with understanding is leverage.

The winning move:

→ Use AI to accelerate
→ Review what it produces
→ Own what you ship

I'll be honest - I've violated my own advice. Skipped the review. Shipped anyway. The shortcuts are tempting.

That's exactly why this matters. Good habits erode faster than they build.

Engineers who use AI without understanding will replace themselves - slowly, then all at once.

Where do you draw the line between leveraging AI and trusting it blindly?
