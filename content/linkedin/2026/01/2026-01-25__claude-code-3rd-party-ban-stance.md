Claude Code is banning all 3rd-party tools on Pro/Max plans. People are moving to OpenCode. Motivations are real. I am not chasing.

What I'm seeing:
→ Some keep using Claude Code, then switch models.
→ Some use GLM as a backup.
→ Some start Ollama for local LLM.

Me:
→ I'm staying on Claude Code.
→ I'm building my system.
→ I'm refining workflow, standards, and reusable skills.

My stance:
👉 System first → Model second
👉 Foundation first → Speed follows
👉 Workflow first → Skill second → Model follows

Reality check:
⚡ Buying a tool takes seconds
🧠 Learning the skill takes weeks

Agent skills, MCP, A2A. These are becoming standard. Learn those instead.

Ban. Good or bad?
↔ Adds friction where workflows were working
↔ Forces discipline and exposes weak systems

If your system is strong, model changes become a detail.
