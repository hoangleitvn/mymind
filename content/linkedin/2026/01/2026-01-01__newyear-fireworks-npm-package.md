🎆 Just shipped my first npm package of 2026!

newyear-fireworks — Bring fireworks to your terminal with one command.

Grateful for all the connections and opportunities this year. Happy New Year 2026!

Try it now:

npx newyear-fireworks

Custom messages with intensity options:

npx newyear-fireworks -t "Happy New Year 2026!" -i high
npx newyear-fireworks -t "Chúc mừng năm mới!" --vn

Built for both New Year and the upcoming **Lunar New Year (TẾT)**!

Features Vietnamese & Chinese zodiac support:

npx newyear-fireworks --zodiac
npx newyear-fireworks --vn -y 2026  # Year of the Horse
