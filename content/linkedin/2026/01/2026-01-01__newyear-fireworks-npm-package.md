🎆 Just shipped my first npm package of 2026!

newyear-fireworks — Bring fireworks to your terminal with one command.

Grateful for all the connections and opportunities this year. Happy New Year 2026!

Custom messages with intensity options:

Built for both New Year and the upcoming **Lunar New Year (TẾT)**!
