Your AWS bill is 30-50% higher than it needs to be.
Here's how to fix it.

After years optimizing client AWS spend, 6 strategies that actually work:

1/ Right-sizing → 20-40% savings
↳ Most teams pick m5.xlarge "to be safe." m5.large handles the load. That's $140/month wasted per instance.

2/ Savings Plans → 30-72% discount
↳ Commit to usage, get discounts. More flexible than Reserved Instances. Start with 50% of baseline.

3/ Auto-scaling → 20-60% savings
↳ Provision for peak, run 24/7 = 60% waste during off-peak. Scale down when demand drops.

4/ Spot Instances → 60-90% savings
↳ Spare AWS capacity at steep discounts. Works for batch jobs, CI/CD, dev environments.

5/ Storage tiering → 40-80% savings
↳ S3 Standard vs Deep Archive = 23x price difference. Set lifecycle policies once.

6/ Serverless → varies
↳ Cuts costs 50-80% for sporadic workloads. Doubles costs for steady high-volume. Know which you have.

WHERE TO START:

Right-sizing + Savings Plans.

Low effort. Low risk. 30-50% savings for most teams.
