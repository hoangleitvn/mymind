If you ship code without reviewing it, I will replace you with AI.

Not a threat. Just math.

AI generates code. If you also just generate code without verifying, you're redundant.

I've been watching my team use AI for the past year. We ship faster. That part is real.

But when something breaks, the answers are always the same:

I thought it was tested.
The AI generated that part.
It looked fine in the review.

Everyone did their job. Nobody owned the outcome.

AI generates code faster than humans can verify it. Verification debt compounds daily now, not monthly.

The engineers who thrive in Software 2.0 are the ones who verify better. Who understand what they ship. Who own the thinking when AI does the typing.

This is issue #4 of Builds That Last.

The question isn't "how fast can you ship?"

It's "who's accountable when things break?"

What's your team's biggest accountability gap?
