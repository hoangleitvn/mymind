Vibe coding can build a prototype in 2 days.
It can also break your app when real users show up.
Here's what nobody tells you about shipping fast with AI.

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘃𝗶𝗯𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:
→ Hackathons and demos
→ Validating an idea before investing
→ Internal tools nobody else maintains
→ Learning a new stack quickly
→ Quick prototype during a client meeting

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘃𝗶𝗯𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝘀:
→ Real users with real data
→ Team members who need to understand your code
→ Compliance, security, anything regulated
→ 3am debugging code you didn't write

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜'𝘃𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗴𝗼 𝘄𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴:
→ Stripe still in test mode when users started paying
→ API secrets pushed to public GitHub
→ Auth flows that looked fine until someone tried edge cases

The pattern I keep seeing: Founder vibe codes MVP → Gets traction → Tries to scale → Everything breaks → Hires engineers to rebuild from scratch.

The expensive lesson: You don't save time. You borrow it.

Building is 20% of the work. Maintenance is 80%.

Vibe coding optimizes for the 20%. Then the 80% kills you.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:

1/ Vibe code to validate, not to ship.
↳ Prototype fast. Then rewrite with understanding.

2/ Know your transition point.
↳ Real users? Real money? Real team? Time to switch modes.

3/ Understand what you're deploying.
↳ Code you can't explain is debt you can't fix.

AI won't make you an engineer.
It will make you a faster version of what you already are.

Vibe coding is the spark.
Engineering is the fire that keeps it alive.

Where do you draw the line?
