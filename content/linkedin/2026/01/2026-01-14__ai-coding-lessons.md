15+ years of engineering. 1 year of AI-assisted development.
5 lessons that hurt to learn.

DHH walked back his skepticism. Jaana Dogan's "1 year → 1 hour" post went viral. Boris Cherny runs 5 Claude sessions in parallel.

The hype is real. So are the failures nobody posts about.

𝟱 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗜 𝗴𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴:

1/ Expecting 10x productivity
Reality: 1.5-2x. The value isn't generating apps from prompts. It's the 30-40% of repetitive work: boilerplate, tests, refactoring. Addy Osmani nailed this.

2/ Skipping context and constraints
"Build X" gives chaos. Boris Cherny's team uses CLAUDE.md files. Every mistake becomes a rule. Context compounds.

3/ Trusting outputs without validation
Jaana Dogan clarified her viral post: "The result was not flawless and would still need human attention." Even 1-hour miracles need review.

4/ Using AI for architecture decisions
AI optimizes for what it's seen before. Novel problems get average solutions. Architecture still needs human judgment.

5/ Ignoring skill atrophy
After heavy AI use, one developer found "things that used to be instinct became manual, even cumbersome." The muscle memory fades.

𝟯 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗲𝗱:

1/ Building the foundation first
Before AI writes a line, I know what "correct" looks like. Tests, types, patterns. The foundation catches hallucinations.

2/ Using AI for exploration, not production
Prototype in minutes. Test approaches. Then rewrite properly. Jaana's advice: "Try them where you already know the ground well enough to see both strengths and limits."

3/ Treating it as pair programming, not automation
Explain context. Review everything. Ask it to explain choices. The conversation improves the output.

The teams struggling with AI skip the foundation.

They chase 10x. Trust outputs blindly. Lose the skills that made them valuable.

Foundation first. Speed follows.

Are you chasing 10x or building foundation first?
