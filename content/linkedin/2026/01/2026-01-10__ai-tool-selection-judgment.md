Asked an engineer why they use ChatGPT web.
Copilot was right there in their IDE.

They couldn't explain it.

Not "I prefer ChatGPT because X." Just... habit. They reach for the browser tab without thinking about which tool fits the task.

This pattern keeps showing up.

Teams have 3+ AI coding tools. Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor. Licenses paid. Tools installed. But nobody decided when to use which.

The adoption worked. The judgment didn't.

Here's the gap I see:

→ Inline completion (Copilot) for boilerplate and repetitive code
→ Chat interfaces (ChatGPT/Claude) for explaining, debugging, architecture questions
→ Agent workflows (Cursor/Codex) for multi-file changes

Most engineers never made this explicit. They default to whatever they opened first.

Tool proliferation without selection criteria means wasted context switches and wasted licenses.

The fix is simple: make the decision conscious. Pick the right tool for the task before you start.

Does your team have clear guidelines on which AI tool to use when?
