# Why I Started Builds That Last

For years, I told myself I'd write "when I have time".

I never had time. There was always another project, another client, another problem to solve.

But something shifted recently. I realized the lessons I've accumulated over 15+ years aren't useful sitting in my head. They're useful when they help someone else avoid the mistakes I made.

So I'm writing.

## The Trigger

A few months ago, I looked at a project my team had been building. Something I thought could become a reusable foundation for future work.

What I found: gaps everywhere. Missing architecture. No standards. Code that worked but nobody could explain why.

The team wasn't bad. *I was.* I hadn't given them enough clarity upfront. I assumed they understood my intent. They didn't.

That project became a mirror. It showed me how much knowledge stays trapped in my head. Ideas I've never articulated. Patterns I follow instinctively but never documented. Lessons from failures I've never shared.

> If my own team doesn't have access to what I know, what's the point of knowing it?

## What I've Been Doing Instead

I've spent 15 years building. Over 50 projects. Startups, enterprises, legacy systems, greenfield builds.

My team has maintained systems 20+ years old where "read the code" was the only documentation. I've led teams through rewrites that should have been avoided. I've shipped fast and spent months fixing what we shipped.

I've learned a lot. But learning isn't the same as teaching. And teaching isn't the same as writing it down where it can reach people I'll never meet.

**I've been hoarding knowledge instead of sharing it.**

## Why Writing Matters Now

The AI conversation made this urgent.

My feed is full of "everyone can build now" and "engineering teams are obsolete." I use AI tools every day. The productivity gains are real.

But there's a gap between what people post and what I see in actual projects.

> The posts show demos. Reality is production systems that break. The posts celebrate shipping fast. Reality is teams spending months paying back technical debt.

Nobody's talking about the **80% of engineering** that isn't demos and launches. The maintenance. The legacy systems. The decisions that compound over years.

I have something to say about that part.

## What I Want to Write About

Not advice copied from Twitter threads. Not theory without proof.

What I've actually learned from **building things that had to work**:

How to think about architecture without overcomplicating it. Why foundation matters more than speed (and how foundation actually enables speed). How to use AI without creating faster technical debt. What engineering leadership looks like when you're in the weeds, not watching from above.

Stories from real projects. The successes. The failures. The lessons that only come from doing this work for years.

## What's Coming

I'm starting a publication called [Builds That Last](https://buildsthatlast.substack.com/).

Longer pieces will live here. Deeper explorations of engineering, leadership, and building things that survive contact with reality.

I'll also keep sharing shorter thoughts on LinkedIn. Observations. The things I notice while building and leading.

## Who This Is For

If you've ever inherited a system with no documentation and thought "why did they build it this way?" - I'm writing for you.

If you've shipped fast and spent months fixing what you shipped - I'm writing for you.

If you're using AI tools and wondering why your team isn't magically 10x more productive - I'm writing for you.

If you're becoming an engineering leader and realizing the job is different than you expected - I'm writing for you.

## Why Writing, Specifically

Here's what I've learned about my own thinking: I don't know if it's right until I say it out loud.

Ideas in my head feel clear. Then I try to write them down and realize: gaps, contradictions, things I assumed but never tested.

**Writing forces clarity. Sharing invites challenge.**

> You can't sharpen a blade in the dark. You need friction. You need contact.

Writing is how I create that contact.

The loop looks like this:

**Think.** Form an opinion from experience.
**Write.** Force myself to be specific.
**Share.** Let others poke holes.
**Learn.** Absorb what I missed.
**Think better.** Refine, repeat.

This isn't "building authority" or "content marketing." It's *thinking out loud*. *Learning in public*. *Refining through friction*.

## The Real Shift

I used to code overnight to meet deadlines. I wrote everything myself. The euphoria of solving hard problems with my own hands.

Then I founded INNOMIZE. Moved from writing code to leadership. Customer relationships, operations, growth. The non-tech stuff that actually matters for building a company.

AI changed things again. Not because it replaced coding. Because it forced me to think differently.

> I shifted from *HOW to solve* a problem to *HOW to frame* a problem.

Not just for AI. For humans too.

When you frame a problem well, there's less back and forth. Fewer misunderstandings. Faster results.

**The old way:** React to problems. Prompt to prompt. Type more, think less. Keep knowledge in my head.

**The new way:** Design workflows where AI fits naturally. Focus on architecture, constraints, guardrails. Structure my knowledge so I can share it publicly.

I still write code. But differently. I write constraints. Validation rules. Guardrails. Lessons learned.

**Less doing, more directing. Less reacting, more architecting. Less prompting, more thinking.**

## The Questions I Ask Now

How can I package my 15+ years of experience?
How can I structure it so others learn faster?
How can I make what I know useful to people I'll never meet?

These questions led me here.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Writing is hard for me.

I'm more comfortable building than explaining. More comfortable doing than teaching. More comfortable in code than in words.

But I've realized that's a limitation, not a strength.

The best engineers I've worked with can explain their thinking. The best leaders I've followed can articulate *why*, not just *what*.

> The knowledge that stays in one person's head dies when they leave.

I don't want my lessons to die with my career. I want them to help someone else build something better.

## Starting Now

I have 15 years of experience. I have ideas worth sharing. I have a system to capture and structure what I learn.

Now I'm putting it out there.

Let's see where this goes.
