Upgrade your AI skills like you upgrade your body.

An AI without tools is a brain without hands.

Watched engineers adopt AI tools: GPT, Claude, Cursor.

Six months later, same workflow:

→ Ask a question
→ Copy the answer
→ Paste into code
→ Ask another question
→ Repeat

It's like the guy at the gym. Chest day every day. Skips legs. Skips back. Skips everything else.

Looks impressive. Performs worse.

Here's how I see it now:

→ The agent is the whole body
→ The LLM is the brain
→ Tools are the hands
→ Skills are trained hands for specific work
→ MCP is how you connect to the outside world

The brain reasons. But brains don't ship.

Hands ship.

The engineer copy-pasting all day? Training the brain only.

The engineer with tools, skills, and workflows? Training the whole body.

Same brain. Complete system. Different results.

Workflow first. Skills second. Tools follow.

What part of your AI body needs work?
