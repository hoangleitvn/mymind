Everyone shares "1,000 prompts for every situation."
Most are useless. Here's why.

4 problems with prompt libraries:

1. Coverage gaps
Most cover 20-30% of actual work needs.

2. Quickly outdated
Built for last year's tools and use cases.

3. Untested
Rarely verified against alternatives.

4. Inconsistent results
Same prompts produce variable outputs even with identical conditions.

But here's the real problem: prompts don't transfer.

A prompt that works in one context fails in another.

You copy a "perfect" prompt from a library, use it with your data, and get garbage.

Why?

The prompt was designed for different context, different tone, different constraints.

What matters more than collecting prompts: understanding why they work so you can write your own.

What's been your experience with prompt libraries?
