80% of the projects we built failed.

It wasn't the code.

I sat down with a partner we've worked with for 10+ years. We did the math.

Same pattern every time: MVP finished, launched, ran for a month, stopped.

The code worked. The execution was solid. That wasn't the problem.

The problem: discovery was skipped.

CB Insights found 35% of startups fail because there's no market need. Not bad execution. No market need.

That's a discovery problem.

AI makes building cheap. You can ship an MVP in a weekend. The barrier to building has collapsed.

But the barrier to building something people want hasn't changed.

When anyone can build anything, the differentiator is knowing what to build.

This is the second issue of Builds That Last.

Full breakdown of what discovery actually looks like and how to do it before you write a single line of code.

What's your approach to validating ideas before building?
