We cut $8,000/month from one AWS bill.
Here are 12 hidden costs you cannot miss.

After years of AWS audits, we keep finding the same patterns:

1. Data egress fees (cross-region + internet)
2. Unattached Elastic IPs ($3.60/month each)
3. Old EBS snapshots ($2,500/month for 50TB)
4. Stopped EC2 instances (EBS still charges)
5. Unused load balancers in dev/staging
6. Cross-region replication enabled and forgotten
7. NAT Gateway charges ($100+/month per AZ)
8. Over-provisioned EBS IOPS (io2 you don't need)
9. S3 API request costs at scale
10. CloudWatch logs with infinite retention
11. Incomplete S3 multipart uploads
12. DynamoDB provisioned capacity misconfig

The pattern: set and forget.

Not hidden in the console. Hidden because nobody thinks to look.

We wrote up all 12 with what to check and how to fix. Plus two real case studies showing $8k/month saved.
