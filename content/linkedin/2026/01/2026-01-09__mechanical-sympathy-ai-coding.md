Most engineers use AI tools backwards.

They fight the tool or blindly trust it. Both fail.

AWS calls this "mechanical sympathy": using a tool with understanding of how it operates best.

The concept applies directly to AI-assisted development.

Vibe coders have zero mechanical sympathy. They prompt, accept, ship. When it breaks, they prompt again. No understanding of why the AI suggested what it did.

Effective engineers have high mechanical sympathy. They know:

→ LLMs are better at generating than validating
→ Context window matters more than clever prompts
→ AI confidently produces plausible nonsense
→ Small, focused requests beat complex instructions

The skill shift: from "how do I make AI write this code" to "how does this AI work best, and how do I align my workflow to it?"

Same tool. Different results.

Mechanical sympathy is why one engineer ships working features with AI while another debugs AI-generated bugs all day.

What's your approach to understanding the AI tools you use?
