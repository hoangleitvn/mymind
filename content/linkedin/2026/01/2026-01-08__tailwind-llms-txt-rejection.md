TailwindCSS rejected llms.txt.
They made the right call. Here's why.

Last week, Adam Wathan closed a PR that would make Tailwind's docs LLM-friendly.

The same week, he announced 75% of the engineering team was laid off.

The connection isn't coincidental.

AI tools train on public documentation. They generate Tailwind code automatically. Developers stop visiting the docs. Traffic drops. They never discover paid products.

Result: 80% revenue decline despite the framework being more popular than ever.

This is the open source sustainability crisis nobody's talking about.

llms.txt makes docs easier for AI to consume. For projects dependent on docs traffic for revenue, that's accelerating their own demise.

Wathan's choice:

→ Prioritize business survival over AI accessibility
→ Focus limited resources on what pays the bills
→ Buy time to find a sustainable model

Some called it short-sighted. I call it survival.

Open source projects that give everything away to AI without a sustainability model won't be around to maintain the tools we depend on.

How should open source projects balance AI accessibility with business sustainability?
