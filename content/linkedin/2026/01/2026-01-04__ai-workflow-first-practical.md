Bookmark this on AI-assisted development that actually works.

Over the holidays, I compiled research from Spotify, Vercel, IBM, McKinsey, Stanford, and more.

One pattern kept repeating:
90% of companies invested in AI.
Less than 40% report measurable gains.

The gap isn't tools. It's workflow.

Here's the evidence:
→ 40% of Copilot outputs contain security vulnerabilities
→ 36% of vibe coders skip QA entirely
→ Only 30% trust AI output without review
→ 20-40% individual gains rarely scale to team gains without process changes

The productivity split I've observed:
• 20% of engineers see 5x gains
• 60% see 2x gains
• 20% see almost nothing

The difference? Validators are 3x more productive than copy-pasters.

The formula: Workflow first. Skills second. Tools last.

The skills that matter: problem framing, decomposition, evaluation, systems thinking.

AI can't do these for you.

THE CASE STUDIES

Spotify — Background Coding Agent (3 series)
→ Workflow design over tool selection
→ Context engineering > raw capability
→ Predictable results through feedback loops

Vercel — "We Removed 80% of Our Agent's Tools"
→ Fewer tools = more reliable outputs
→ Constraints improve agent decisions

IBM — watsonx Code Assistant Study
→ Only 2-4% use AI output without modification
→ Most use AI for learning and ideation, not copy-paste
🔗 https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06603

Coder — Enterprise Adoption Lessons
→ AI must be native to developer experience, not bolted on
→ Crawl-walk-run. Strategies that jump to "run" fail.

DX Research — Best Practices
→ Most valuable uses: stack trace analysis, refactoring, test generation

THE RESEARCH

McKinsey — "Agents, Robots, and Us" (2025)
→ 57% of US work hours could be automated
→ $2.9T potential value unlock by 2030

Stack Overflow Developer Survey (2025)
→ 84% use AI tools
→ Only 33% trust output without review
🔗 https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025

Stanford CS146S — The Modern Software Developer
→ First end-to-end AI development course
→ Core philosophy: "System first, model second"

TOOLS WORTH EXPLORING

Spec-Driven Development:
→ Speckit: https://github.com/speckai/speckit
→ OpenSpec: https://openspec.dev
→ AWS Kiro: https://kiro.dev

Agent Management:
→ Vibe Kanban: https://github.com/PaulJPhilp/vibe-kanban
→ CCPM Agile-fit: https://github.com/ddlaws0n/ccpm

The tool is 20% of the outcome.
The workflow is 80%.

What's your workflow for AI-assisted development?
