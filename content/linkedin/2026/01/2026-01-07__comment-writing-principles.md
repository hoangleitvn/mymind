Most LinkedIn comments are noise.

"Great post!" "Love this!" "So true!"

These add nothing. They're forgettable. They don't start conversations.

Here's how I approach comments differently:

**One rule:** Would I actually say this to them in person?

If I wouldn't say it at a conference, I don't type it.

**Five principles:**

1. **Respond to ONE thing.** Not the whole post. The single detail that sparked something in me.

2. **Share, don't teach.** "We found..." not "You should..." I'm contributing to their conversation, not lecturing.

3. **Be specific or be quiet.** If I can't add a real example, observation, or question, I skip it.

4. **Keep it short.** 2-3 sentences default. Longer only when the value justifies it.

5. **End naturally.** No forced questions. If one emerges, ask it. If not, just stop.

**What I avoid:**

→ Empty praise ("Great insight!")
→ Making it about me ("At my company we...")
→ Tagging my followers
→ Dropping links to my content

The goal isn't visibility. It's connection.

The best comments feel like the start of a real conversation. Not a performance.

What's your filter for deciding when to comment?
