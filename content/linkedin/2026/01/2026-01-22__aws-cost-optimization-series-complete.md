$8,000/month. One AWS bill. One audit.
That's what we cut for a client.

We've run AWS cost audits for years. The same patterns keep appearing.

Teams copy-paste infrastructure templates. 
Nobody sets snapshot retention.
NAT Gateways run in every AZ "just in case".
CloudWatch logs grow forever.

We wrote everything we know into a 3-part series.

PART 1: Where the money leaks
→ 12 hidden costs most teams miss
→ Snapshot accumulation ($2,500/month for 50TB)
→ Dormant resources, NAT charges, infinite log retention
→ Two case studies: $10k/month reduced to $2k/month

PART 2: How to stop the leaks
→ 6 strategies with real savings percentages
→ Right-sizing: 20-40% compute savings
→ Savings Plans: 30-72% discount
→ Spot instances: 60-90% for fault-tolerant workloads
→ Storage tiering: 40-80% on S3

PART 3: The audit playbook
→ 5-phase process (Preparation → Discovery → Analysis → Implementation → Monitoring)
→ 4-8 hours for small-to-medium accounts
→ Compliance checklists included
→ Run it quarterly

Combined strategies typically deliver 30-50% savings.

This series covers what we've learned from our client environments. 

No theory. No generic advice. Just the patterns that keep appearing and the fixes that work.

Links to Part 1 and the Playbook in comments.

Comment "PLAYBOOK" and I'll send you the spreadsheet we use to run these audits.

What's the most surprising charge you've found on your AWS bill?
