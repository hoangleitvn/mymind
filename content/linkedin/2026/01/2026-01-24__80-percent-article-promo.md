I've spent more time reading code than writing it.

That's not a failure. That's engineering.

My teams maintain systems 20+ years old. No documentation. Original developers gone. When we ask about business logic, the answer is always: **read the code**.

Chainguard surveyed 1,200 engineers. They spend 16% of their week writing code. 79% pointed to maintenance as where the time actually goes.

Nobody posts about this part.

Everyone shares greenfield projects. Weekend MVPs. AI demos. Nobody shares the brownfield reality of understanding systems they didn't build.

Right now we're rebuilding a system we vibe coded. No spec. No architecture. A new engineer asked why something worked. Nobody knew.

AI made it easy to ship. When we tried to scale, we hit the wall.

AI is an amplifier. No foundation? It makes your gaps visible.

That's exactly what happened to us.

This is issue #3 of Builds That Last.

Most teams don't choose the 80%. They inherit it.

What does yours look like?
