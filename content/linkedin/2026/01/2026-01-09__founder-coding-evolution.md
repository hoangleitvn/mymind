I used to code overnight to meet deadlines.
Today, I still write code. Just differently.

Years ago, I wrote everything myself. C, C++, C#, VB, Java, PHP, JavaScript...
Sometimes confused VB syntax when coding in C#.

From fully coding to less coding (low code, no code).
From on-premise to cloud computing.
From monolith to microservices.
From VM to Docker.
From Azure to AWS, and everything in between.

I built a social network while studying at university. Never shipped it.
I built what I called a "skeleton" - a framework to help us build apps faster and more maintainable.
I firefighted production issues at 2am, responding every 15 minutes until the system was stable.

I loved it. The euphoria of solving hard problems with my own hands.

Then things shifted.

I founded INNOMIZE in 2018. Moved from writing code to leadership. Customer relationships, operations, growth. The non-tech stuff that actually matters for building a company.

I used to think I needed to build a sales team to find projects.

But after some reflection, I changed my mind.

My LinkedIn profile was dead. Low engagement, low connections.
My Medium/Dev 
Our core value is sharing. But we only shared internally.
I shared architecture principles, standards, best practices with my team. But each project applied them differently.

I typed my ideas, tested them, iterated. It was slow.

Then AI changed everything.

Not because it replaced coding. Replace my engineering team.
Because it forced me to think differently.
Coding. Building. Learning. Sharing. Growing. Networking. Living.

💡 I shifted from HOW to solve a problem to HOW to frame a problem.

Not just for AI. For humans too.

When you frame a problem well, there's less back and forth. Fewer hallucinations. Faster results.

❌ The old way:
→ React to the problem
→ Prompt to prompt
→ Type more, think less
→ Keep knowledge in my head

✅ The new way:
→ Redesign the workflow where AI fits naturally
→ Less typing, more focus on architecture, constraints, guardrails, validation
→ Define systems where AI and I communicate better without repeating context each prompt
→ Structure my knowledge and experience so I can share it publicly

I still write code. But differently.
I'm still CxO of the company. Someone has to jump in when things break.

But now I write constraints. Validation rules. Guardrails. Learned lessons. Building that last.
I design workflows where my team uses AI with better results and lower risks.

You can buy AI tools, courses, frameworks, certifications, copilots.
You cannot buy judgment, experience, taste, context.

Buying AI tools is easy. Training people to use them well is the hard part.

🎯 The real shift?

From coding in isolation to building systems where my thinking is captured, structured, and shareable.

How can I package my 15+ years of experience?
How can I structure it so others learn faster?
How can I monetize what I already know?

These are the questions I ask now.

AI is a good tool.

But AI alone doesn't create value.
Knowing WHAT to build and WHY creates value.

Who figure this out will lead the next decade.

I believe AI can help. But only if you know what you're doing and why you're doing it.

Less doing. More directing.
Less reacting. More architecting.
Less firefighting. More planning.
Less prompting. More thinking.
Less how. More why.

What shifted for you when AI entered your workflow?
