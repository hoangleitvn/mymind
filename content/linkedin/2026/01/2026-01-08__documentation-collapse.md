StackOverflow used to see hundreds of thousands of questions every month at its peak.
Today, activity is a fraction of that.

Developers did not stop learning.
They stopped asking publicly. They ask AI instead.

Tooling companies built on documentation and reuse are under pressure.
Frameworks that once sold convenience now compete with prompts.

Two shifts. Same pattern.

Documentation is no longer the destination.
Frameworks are no longer the product.

Here is the uncomfortable question.

If human knowledge sharing slows down, what trains the next generation of models?

We trained AI on human discussion, examples, arguments, mistakes.
Now humans are sharing less. Or sharing privately with machines.

If that continues, models plateau.

This is the real build vs buy debate.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗯𝘂𝘆

𝗝𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁
→ Debugging intuition
→ Knowing when AI is confidently wrong
→ Knowing which correct answers to ignore

𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲
→ Pattern recognition from past failures
→ Memory of what breaks at scale
→ Mental models earned by shipping real systems

𝗧𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲
→ Knowing what "good" looks like
→ Architectural trade-off sense
→ When to stop optimizing

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁
→ Reading code others wrote and understanding intent
→ Seeing how pieces actually connect
→ Knowing what questions matter

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗯𝘂𝘆
→ AI tools
→ Courses
→ Frameworks
→ Certifications
→ Copilots
→ Subscriptions

One list keeps shrinking.
The other keeps growing.

When shared knowledge dries up, the developers who matter most are the ones who built their own.

Which of these did you only learn after something broke in production?
