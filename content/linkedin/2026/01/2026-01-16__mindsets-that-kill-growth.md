You'll NEVER grow if you keep these mindsets.

After tons of one-on-ones, the same patterns keep showing up.

AT WORK:

→ "I'm waiting for my opportunity"
Builders don't wait. They create.

→ "That's not my responsibility"
Ownership has no job description.

→ "I want to lead someday"
Wanting is not becoming. Leading starts before the title.

→ "I don't know what I don't know"
Then go find out. Ignorance is only permanent if you let it be.

→ "When things slow down, I'll learn"
Things never slow down. Growth happens in the chaos, not after it.

IN LIFE:

→ "When I have money, then I'll..."
You're waiting to live a life that's already happening.

→ "It's not my fault"
Blame feels good. It also keeps you exactly where you are.

→ "I need motivation to start"
Motivation follows action. Discipline creates motivation.

→ "They should recognize my value"
If you don't value yourself, why would anyone else?

→ "I'll figure it out someday"
Someday is not on the calendar.

THE PATTERN:

Every stuck person I've met thinks:
HAVE → DO → BE

"When I HAVE the title, I'll DO leadership work, then I'll BE a leader."
"When I HAVE time, I'll DO the learning, then I'll BE skilled."

Jim Rohn taught me it works the other way:
BE → DO → HAVE

BE the leader now. DO the work without the title. HAVE the results follow.

BE the learner now. DO the studying in the chaos. HAVE the skills emerge.

You don't get the mindset after you succeed.
You succeed because you had the mindset first.

Which of these hit home?
