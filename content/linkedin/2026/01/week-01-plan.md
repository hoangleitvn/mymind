## Topic Details

### Monday: AI Reality Check (Published)

**File**: `2026-01-05__ai-reality-check-2025-promo.md`
**Format**: Data-driven article promo
**Article**: https://innomizetech.com/blog/the-ai-reality-check-what-2025-taught-us

### Tuesday: 10 Signs You Build to Last

**File**: `2026-01-06__10-signs-build-to-last.md` (draft ready)
**Format**: List-based (kevin-box style)
**Hook**: "The best engineers I know aren't the fastest coders."
**Angle**: Documentation and leaving breadcrumbs for future maintainers

Signs:
1. You write the README before the code
2. Your commit messages tell a story
3. You document decisions, not just outcomes
4. You explain the "why" behind the "what"
5. You think about the maintainer in 5 years
6. You treat docs as part of the feature
7. You name things like someone else will read them
8. You write tests that explain intent
9. You leave TODOs with context
10. You know speed without context is debt

**Expected performance**: High (list format + documentation angle)

### Wednesday: Serverless vs Containers Decision

**File**: `2026-01-07__serverless-vs-containers-decision.md` (draft ready)
**Format**: Decision framework (standalone value)
**Hook**: "Should we use serverless or containers? My answer used to be simple."
**Angle**: How Lambda Managed Instances changes the old decision tree

Key points:
- Old decision tree (sporadic → serverless, steady → containers)
- What changed with Managed Instances
- New decision tree with 3 paths (Lambda Standard, Managed Instances, ECS/EKS)
- Pragmatic answer: most teams use both

### Thursday: 7 Questions Before Writing Any Code

**Format**: List-based (checklist style)
**Hook**: "Before you write a single line..."

Questions:
1. What problem am I solving?
2. Who is this for?
3. What happens if I don't build this?
4. What's the simplest version?
5. How will I know it works?
6. What can break?
7. How will someone else understand this?

### Friday: Platform Engineering Build vs Buy

**Format**: Technical insight
**Angle**: 2026 landscape (Kubernetes, Internal Developer Platforms)

Structure:
- What platform engineering actually means
- The build trap (custom tooling debt)
- The buy trap (vendor lock-in)
- Middle ground: compose, don't build from scratch

### Saturday: The One Feature I Wish I Hadn't Built

**Format**: Story + lesson
**Angle**: Personal experience, technical takeaway

Structure:
- The feature (something specific from INNOMIZE experience)
- Why it seemed like a good idea
- What went wrong
- The lesson: validation before building

### Next Week Preview: From IC to CTO

Move to Monday Jan 12 (personal story works as Monday hook too)
