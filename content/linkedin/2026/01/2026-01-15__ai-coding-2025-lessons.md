After months of working with AI actually taught me.

Not the hype. Not the theory. What I learned shipping real work.

𝟱 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗜 𝗴𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴:

1/ Thinking AI saves time.
↳ It shifts where you spend time. Less typing, more reviewing. Less coding, more designing. The work changes, the hours don't.

2/ Chasing tools.
↳ 4 tool switches per year = 12 weeks learning curves = 25% of year lost. The tool you have is probably fine. The question: have you changed how you work?

3/ Vibe coding everything.
↳ Worked for prototypes. Broke at scale. Code I didn't understand became debt I couldn't fix.

4/ Jumping to agents before workflows.
↳ 78% use AI, only 23% use agents. That's intentional. Agents amplify your workflow. If your workflow is messy, agents amplify the mess.

5/ Thinking we need ML engineers.
↳ Most AI products build on foundation models. You need engineers who can ship AI products, not researchers who can train models. Systems experience + AI learning beats AI credentials + no systems experience.

𝟯 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗲𝗱:

1/ Document first, code second.
↳ Quick BRD → Architecture sketch → Then prompts. AI is 10x better when it knows the context.

2/ Separate modes: Architecture vs Implementation.
↳ Design decisions in one session. Code in another. Mixing them confuses both you and the AI.

3/ Foundation before features.
↳ Skills before agents. Workflows before automation. Boring? Yes. But I stopped rebuilding the same thing every week.

𝗠𝘆 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟲:

→ Workflow redesign over tool adoption
→ Local context and memory (cloud APIs change, local knowledge stays)
→ Document-first culture that compounds

AI won't make you an engineer.
It will make you a faster version of what you already are.

Still early. Still exploring.

What's your biggest AI lesson from 2025?
