Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity now supports Agent Skills.

Skills now is Open Standard. Build once. Run everywhere.

Most people are still building for one platform. They write prompts for ChatGPT. Or Claude. Or Gemini. Then they start over when they switch.

It doesn't work that way anymore.

The reality? New AI drops every week. You can't keep up. You shouldn't try. Build what works for you.

Here's what's happening:

1/ Skills Are Portable Now
↳ Same skill file. Different AI backends. Same results.

2/ Context Is the Moat, Not the Platform
↳ Your identity, voice, and workflows travel with you.

3/ Lock-In Is a Losing Strategy
↳ Platforms that trap you will lose to platforms that free you.

4/ Build Once, Run Everywhere
↳ Same skill. Any AI backend. No vendor lock-in.

5/ The Best AI Is the One That Fits Your Workflow
↳ Not the one that forces you to change it.

What this means for builders:

→ Build portable skills, not platform-specific solutions
→ Design skills as portable units
→ Treat context as your competitive advantage
→ Let the AI race benefit you, not trap you

Skip the AI platform wars. Build your workflow instead.

Your workflow. Your system. Yours to keep.

AI platforms will come and go. Protocols will converge.

But the system you build? That's what AI amplifies.

No workflow, no amplification. No matter which AI wins.

P/S. One thing I'd love to see: a standard directory for all AI platforms. 
No more `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.codex/`, `.agent/` cluttering my workspace. 
One folder. 
All platforms read it.
Unless platform-specific config is truly needed.

That's the dream.
