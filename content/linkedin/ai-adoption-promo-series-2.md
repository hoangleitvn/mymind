# Post 2: The Skills Angle

## Post Content

AI tools don't determine productivity.

Human skills do.

Same tool. Same training. Same access. Yet 20% become 5x more productive while others see minimal gains.

The difference is 5 skills:

1. Problem Framing

Turn vague into testable.

"Make this better" produces garbage.
"Reduce response time from 4 hours to 1 hour" produces results.

2. Decomposition

Split work into verifiable steps.

"Write a quarterly report" is too big. AI will guess wrong.
Break it into: gather data → verify → analyze → verify → draft → format.

3. Evaluation

Know what good looks like before you see AI output.

Teams without this skill accept plausible-looking output. Plausible is not correct.

4. Correction

Fix the 20%, don't regenerate.

Teams that regenerate instead of correct waste enormous time and never improve.

5. Systems Thinking

Make it easier next time.

Build templates. Document what worked. Create a prompt library. Compound your learning.

Tool training is necessary but not sufficient.

These skills determine whether AI multiplies your capability or your mistakes.

Full breakdown with examples: link in comments.

Curious to hear: Which skill does your team need most?
