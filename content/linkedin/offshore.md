Most engineering leaders don’t fail with offshore software engineers because of talent.

They fail because they hire task executors, which just creates more work for them, not less.

What leaders really need is people they can trust to own projects and get things off their plate.

Here’s what I hear on almost every call with leaders trying offshore dev:

“They need approval for every decision.”
“I still had to do all the architectural thinking.”
“They delivered what we asked for… it just wasn’t great.”

That’s not a people problem.

It’s a role clarity and leadership problem.

If you don’t clearly define:

• What technical decisions someone owns
• What outcomes they’re accountable for
• How success is measured beyond “code shipped”

You won’t get leverage. You’ll get people who need to be micromanaged.

The leaders that struggle don’t lack access to good engineers. They lack a system that turns engineers into owners instead of dependency points.

If you want offshore engineers to reduce your workload instead of adding to it, DM me.
