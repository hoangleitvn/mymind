# Post 3: The Warning Signs

## Post Content

5 signs your AI adoption is failing:

1. Quality complaints increase after AI introduction

AI should improve quality or maintain it. If customers notice degradation, something is broken.

The workflow or guardrails aren't working.

2. "AI made a mistake" becomes an excuse

AI doesn't make mistakes. Processes make mistakes.

If people blame AI for errors, accountability isn't clear.

3. Nobody can explain how AI output gets validated

Ask your team: "How do you know this AI output is correct?"

If they can't articulate a clear answer, validation isn't happening.

4. Tool switching every few months

If you keep evaluating new tools looking for the "right" solution, the problem isn't tools.

No tool will solve a workflow problem.

5. Shadow AI emerges

People use personal AI tools because official ones don't fit their workflow.

This signals the implementation doesn't match how work actually gets done.

These aren't AI problems. They're workflow design problems.

Switching tools won't fix them. Redesigning the workflow will.

We wrote a framework for getting AI adoption right: link in comments.

Curious to hear: Which warning sign do you recognize?

If this resonates with someone in your network, repost or save for later.

P.S. Follow for more on AI adoption, engineering leadership, and building teams.

**Comment on Personal Post:**
> Warning sign #5 (shadow AI) is particularly common. When people use personal tools instead of official ones, it's a signal that the implementation doesn't match how work gets done. Start by mapping actual workflows, not ideal workflows.
