I'm not a good architect.
But I've built many systems.

I'm not a good cloud engineer.
But most systems I built run on AWS and Azure.

I'm not good at React.
Or Angular. Or Node.js. Or backend. Or DevOps. Or SecOps.

I can't pass a LeetCode interview.
I use AI to solve those problems now.

After 15 years and 50+ projects shipped, here's what I've learned:

The industry celebrates experts.
But generalists ship products.

Deep expertise gets you hired.
Broad competence gets products to users.

The difference?

Experts know everything about one thing.
Shippers know enough about many things.

Enough to design systems.
Enough to lead teams.
Enough to debug at 2am.
Enough to ask AI the right questions.

You don't need to be the best architect.
You need to ship architecture that works.

You don't need to ace LeetCode.
You need to solve real problems.

You don't need certifications.
You need systems running in production.

Know enough to be dangerous.
Know enough to ship.

That's the builder mindset.

What's your take: specialist or generalist?
