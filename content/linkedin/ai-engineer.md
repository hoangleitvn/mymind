Engineering is the part AI can’t do for you yet.
Constraints. Tradeoffs. Verification. Ownership.

9 signs you’re not outsourcing your brain:

1/ Architecture before prompts
2/ “Why” before “how”
3/ Debugging is routine
4/ Tests before deploy
5/ Systems thinking
6/ Clear success criteria
7/ Refactor aggressively
8/ Accountability stays human
9/ Maintainability as default

Which one is your edge?
