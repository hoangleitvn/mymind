I use AI to write my posts. There. I said it. But here's what that actually means:

One of our core values at INNOMIZE is SHARING. Share to learn, learn to share.

I used to write blog posts years ago. Then projects, client work, and business pulled me away. Not because I ran out of ideas. Because writing took too long.

English isn't my native language. I'm Vietnamese.

My old workflow? Type in Vietnamese. Google Translate. Copy-paste. Hit publish. Hope it made sense.

I have insights from 15+ years of building software. Experiences worth sharing. But translating those thoughts into clear, structured English? That was the barrier.

AI removes that barrier.

AI doesn't give me ideas. Years of building, failing, and learning did.

AI helps me structure those lessons into something readable.

But content writing is just one use case.

AI is my daily driver now:
→ Brainstorming product ideas
→ Debugging complex engineering problems
→ Researching unfamiliar domains
→ Drafting client proposals
→ Structuring messy thoughts into clear plans
→ Designing engineering workflow for our team

Same principle everywhere: my judgment, AI's speed.

For content specifically, the math is simple:

Without AI: 2-3 hours per post. Maybe 1 post per week.

With AI: 15-30 minutes per post. More insights shared.

Here's my workflow:

1. I have an insight
2. I dump messy thoughts
3. AI suggests structure
4. I push back and correct
5. Final: 60% AI words, 100% my thinking

The judgment never transfers.

When AI suggested "environment separation costs almost nothing," I corrected it. I pay the AWS bill. AI doesn't.

Here's the other reason I use AI for content:

I respect your time.

You scroll through hundreds of posts. If my insight helps you, but broken grammar buries it, I've wasted your time.

The question isn't "did you use AI?"

The question is: "Does it help someone?"

If yes, the tool doesn't matter.
If no, the tool won't save you.

Goal: Help someone. See my posts saved.

They say 52% of online content is now AI-generated.

I'm part of that number. But I'd rather share useful insights with AI help than stay silent with perfect grammar.

What about you?

P.S. This post and the cover image were generated with AI using my system that I design and build with Claude Code. If that makes you uncomfortable, I understand. If you're doing the same, share your experience.
