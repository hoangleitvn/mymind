"I wish I had 48 hours in a day."

My wife's response: "You'd fill those too."

She's right. And it stung.

I founded INNOMIZE in 2018. Seven years later, I'm still learning this lesson: running consulting while building products means every hour feels squeezed. Family time keeps losing to "just one more thing."

Then I asked myself the hard question:

If I only had 4 hours a day for work, what would I cut?

The answer was uncomfortable. Half of what I do doesn't create real value. Meetings that could be messages. Polishing that could wait. Side projects disguised as strategy.

Wanting more time is the symptom.
Poor priorities are the problem.

Here's what I'm changing:

→ Family time is now a calendar block, not leftover time
→ "Urgent" client work doesn't automatically beat building for the future
→ One thing gets cut every week. No exceptions.

The hard truth I wish someone told me earlier:

Your calendar reflects your real priorities. Not your intentions. Not your goals. Your actual priorities.

If family keeps losing, that's a priority problem, not a time problem.

My wife didn't need me to have more hours. She needed me to protect the hours that matter.

Still learning. Still adjusting. But at least now I know what to fix.

What would you cut if you only had 4 hours a day?
