You got AI licenses 6 months ago. Quality is down. Trust is gone.

Here's the 4-step framework that fixes this.

Most teams picked tools first and figured out use later.

At INNOMIZE, we're navigating this ourselves. And after watching the same pattern across the industry, we developed a framework we're now testing internally.

The insight:

The tool is 20% of the outcome. The workflow is 80%.

The pattern across industries:

→ Marketing: AI writes content, nobody reviews, brand voice drifts
→ Finance: AI generates reports, nobody validates, errors compound
→ Engineering: AI writes code, nobody understands it, tech debt accelerates

The common thread: tools without workflow design equals faster mistakes.

The framework that works:

1. Map the workflow before selecting tools
2. Build skills before scaling usage
3. Establish guardrails before pursuing speed
4. Select tools that fit the workflow

We're being transparent: this comes from observation and first principles. We're applying it ourselves and documenting what works.

Because everyone is still figuring this out.

Full framework with practical adoption steps: link in comments.

Curious to hear: What failure modes are you seeing with AI adoption?

If this resonates with someone in your network, reshare or save for later.
