Claude can now control Chrome. This is what I have been waiting for.

I have been building workflows with Claude Code for content writing, engineering, designing. But something was always missing.

Now with Chrome integration? That gap is gone.

Here is what this unlocks:

→ Schedule my posts directly. No custom MCP server needed.
→ Fetch weekly/monthly post analytics automatically.
→ Send Claude to ChatGPT or Gemini for specific tasks, then return with results.
→ Capture and attach web content to my workspace.
→ Any workflow where actual browser interaction was the blocker.

This morning I had Claude fetch performance metrics for all my LinkedIn posts this week. It navigated to each analytics page, grabbed the stats, and saved them back to my workspace files.

Previously? I would have needed to build a custom integration or do it manually.

How does it work?

Through MCP. Claude Code connects to a Chrome extension that exposes browser actions as tools.

Important caveats:

→ Still in beta. Test before relying on it.
→ Keep interactions slow. Human-like pace. Your accounts can get flagged if you automate too fast.
→ Adds ~14k tokens to context. Only enable when you need it.

To try it:

Run `claude --chrome` and explore.

Or use the Chrome extension directly if you prefer.

I am already planning skills around this. The combination of Claude's reasoning with actual browser control opens possibilities I have been thinking about for months.

What browser workflow would you automate first?
