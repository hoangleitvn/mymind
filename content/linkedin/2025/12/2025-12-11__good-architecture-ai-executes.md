I spent weeks on architecture. Zero features shipped.

It was the best decision I made.

Everyone said "just ship it." I kept designing.

Then I tested: 2 features, built with AI, following the spec.

Both worked first try. No rework. No restructuring. AI executed within the patterns without constant corrections.

That's when I knew the architecture was right.

Here's what I've learned about architecture and AI:

Bad architecture:
→ AI generates code that conflicts with existing patterns
→ Every feature requires rethinking the structure
→ You spend more time fixing than building
→ "Just ship it" becomes "just rewrite it"

Good architecture:
→ AI follows established patterns naturally
→ New features slot into existing structure
→ Execution becomes predictable
→ Foundation enables speed, not blocks it

The validation signal:

If AI can execute within your architecture without constant corrections, the architecture is right.

If every AI-generated feature needs manual restructuring, the architecture is wrong.

This is about clear patterns, not perfect design.

→ Clear patterns = predictable execution
→ Predictable execution = faster shipping
→ Faster shipping = foundation paying off

The "just ship it" crowd misses this: Foundation investment is what makes future shipping fast.

Time spent on architecture is correct sequencing. Not perfectionism.

What's your signal that architecture is working?
