# Post 1: The Main Hook

## Post Content

You got AI licenses 6 months ago. Quality is down. Trust is gone.

Here's the 4-step framework that fixes this.

Most teams picked tools first, then tried to invent a use case later.

At INNOMIZE, we're navigating this ourselves. After seeing the same pattern repeat across teams and industries, we built a simple framework and we're testing it internally.

The insight:

Tools drive about 20% of the outcome. Workflows drive the other 80%.

The pattern shows up everywhere:

→ Marketing: AI drafts content, nobody reviews, brand voice drifts
→ Finance: AI generates reports, nobody validates, errors compound
→ Engineering: AI writes code, nobody can explain it, debt accelerates

Same root cause: tools without workflow design create faster mistakes.

The framework:

Map the workflow before selecting tools

Build skills before scaling usage

Establish guardrails before pursuing speed

Select tools that fit the workflow

Transparent note: this framework comes from observation plus first principles. We're applying it ourselves and documenting what holds up.

Full framework with practical adoption steps: link in comments.

Curious to hear: What failure modes are you seeing with AI adoption?

If this resonates with someone in your network, repost or save for later.

**Repost Message:**
> Workflow first. Skills second. Guardrails third. Tools last.
> We're testing this framework internally and documenting what works. Full breakdown from our CEO.

**Comment on Personal Post:**
> This is the approach we're testing at INNOMIZE. The pattern is consistent across the industry: teams that design workflows first see better results. Teams that buy tools first often see quality degradation.
