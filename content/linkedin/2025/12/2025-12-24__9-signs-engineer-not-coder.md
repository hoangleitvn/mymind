Coding is typing.
Engineering is thinking.
One of them AI can do for you. The other one, it can't.

Some vibe coders are good at design. They see the system. They map the workflow. But design without architecture is a prototype. And prototypes break when the business depends on them.

The reality? AI handles the typing now. The thinking is still on you.

Here are 9 signs you're an engineer, not just a coder:

1/ You design before you prompt
↳ Architecture first. Code generation second.

2/ You ask AI "why" not just "how"
↳ Understanding beats copying.

3/ You can debug what AI writes
↳ When it breaks, and it will, you know where to look.

4/ You validate before you ship
↳ AI is confident. Confidence isn't correctness.

5/ You think in systems, not scripts
↳ How does this fit? What breaks if this changes?

6/ You know what "done" looks like
↳ Before the first prompt, you know the destination.

7/ You refactor AI output
↳ First draft is never final. You make it yours.

8/ You own the decision, not AI
↳ AI suggests. You decide. You're accountable.

9/ You build for the next engineer
↳ Code that only you understand isn't engineering.

AI made coding free. It made engineering more valuable.

The gap between coder and engineer? It's wider than ever.

Which one separates you from the coders? Drop a number below.
