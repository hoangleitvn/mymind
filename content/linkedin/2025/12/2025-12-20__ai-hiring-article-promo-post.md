You don't need ML engineers.

Let Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI do the heavy lifting. Here's why.

I've worked on two AI projects with strong ML talent. PhD credentials. Custom algorithms. Full training pipelines.

Both shipped. Both failed.

Not because of weak models. They failed upstream.

No validated customer need. No clear path to market. We built technically impressive systems for problems nobody was paying to solve.

Here's the reality:

Most AI products today are wrappers around LLMs. You don't need someone who can train a transformer from scratch. You need someone who can build reliable systems.

The hiring equation is backwards.

Companies have a production bottleneck. They hire for a research bottleneck.

I wrote about what these failures taught me:
→ Systems experience + AI learning beats AI credentials + no systems experience
→ Why evaluation and validation are different skills
→ What clients actually ask for (hint: not ML researchers)

Link in comments.

What's blocking your AI projects? Model performance? Or everything around the model?
