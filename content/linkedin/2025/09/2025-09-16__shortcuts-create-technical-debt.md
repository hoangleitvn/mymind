Hacks feel good. Quick wins feel better. But shortcuts usually turn into tomorrow's technical debt.

The best engineering cultures keep it simple:
 🔹 Stay focused on outcomes
 🔹 Build with users, not assumptions
 🔹 Design for scale from the start

These aren’t rules. They’re survival skills for modern product teams.

What principle do you wish every team followed?
