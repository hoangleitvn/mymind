Too many teams default to meetings when things get unclear.
But more meetings don't mean more progress.

Modern engineering is about choosing the right mode of communication:
📆 Use sync (real-time) for urgent or complex discussions where alignment matters.
📝 Use async (written updates) for status, questions, and decisions that don’t need everyone at the same time.

Async gives people focus time. Sync keeps alignment. Together, they create flow instead of burnout.

Practical tips for async:
- Share updates with context, not just bullet points.
- Set clear response times (e.g., "within 24h").
- Write things down: if it’s not documented, it doesn’t exist.
- Respect others’ time: fewer pings, fewer calls.

Fewer meetings. More clarity. Better flow.

If you’re a leader, ask your team: What’s one meeting we could replace with async updates this week?
