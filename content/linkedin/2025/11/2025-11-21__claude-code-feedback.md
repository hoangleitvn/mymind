Dharmesh Shah is switching away from Claude Code.

I'm starting to understand why.

A few days ago I shared thoughts about tool switching. Don't chase benchmarks—chase core stability.

Today I'm living that advice.

Claude Code agent skills launched Oct 17. Issues reported Oct 18. A month later: still unfixed.

Meanwhile, new features ship (MCP code execution, Nov 4).

This pattern repeats across startups:
Ship new features > Fix customer issues

Cursor 2.0. Gemini. Antigravity. The alternatives are real.

Result: Users find workarounds. Then alternatives. Then switch.

What makes senior leaders switch? Not missing features.

Unfixed core issues.

How long can this last?

Here's what matters:
Build around customers. Optimize their experience. Keep them engaged.

Not: Ship features while core issues persist.

To Anthropic: This isn't a complaint. It's feedback from a user who wants to stay.

To the community: Are you facing similar issues? Staying or switching? What's your experience?

Learn from each other. That's how we all improve.
