Budget isn't why founders stay stuck in planning.

Neither is tech stack or team size.

The real blocker? Decision-making.

I've worked with 10+ founders this year. Some shipped in 6 weeks. Others? Still planning after 6 months.

The stuck founders had 3 patterns in common:

𝗕𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀
Waited for the perfect budget. Delayed until they could afford "the full version." Never started phase 1.

The founder who shipped? Broke it into phases. Started with what could launch. Built revenue before building everything.

𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴
Tried to build the complete vision upfront. Every meeting added features. Scope kept growing. Six months later, still no code written.

The founder who shipped? Defined ONE problem to solve first. Built that. Got real users. Let users tell them what to build next.

𝗪𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹
Spent weeks discussing hourly rates, team size, tracking systems. Focused on hours, not outcomes.

The founder who shipped? Found partners who acted like owners. Focused on accountability. Got to live users faster because nobody was counting hours.

The difference wasn't budget. It wasn't features.

It was decision-making.

Stuck founders kept asking: "Do we have enough budget?" "Should we add this feature?" "How do we track everything?"

Founders who shipped asked: "What's the smallest version that solves the problem?" "Can we start with phase 1?" "Who can own this end-to-end?"

You can start smaller than you think.

The gap between planning and shipping is one decision: Will you ship the 20% that matters, or wait until you can build 100%?

What's keeping your MVP in planning mode?
