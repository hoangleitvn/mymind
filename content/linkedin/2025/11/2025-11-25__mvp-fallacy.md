Shipping broken products: bad.
Polishing before anyone uses it: worse.
Here's the trap.

Building a documentation system.
Knew the advice: ship fast, iterate.
Also knew: quality matters.

Middle ground: ship it clean.

What I did:
• Optimized structure
• Cleaned redundancies
• Made everything consistent
• Checked every detail twice

Felt productive. Felt responsible.

Then used the system.

Discovered the real problem:
• Navigation was confusing
• Mental model unclear
• Organization didn't match how people think

Not what I optimized for.

Restructured everything.

Cost:
• Same work done twice
• Hours spent polishing the wrong thing
• Cleanup debt from premature optimization

The Fallacy

Not binary:
• Ship fast + broken (bad)
• Ship slow + polished (good)

Third state (worse than both):
Ship slow + polished for wrong problem.

I optimized efficiency before validating it mattered.
Polished structure before confirming the right one.
Made it "perfect" before knowing what perfect meant.

What Works

Phase 1: Ship something usable
• Get core working
• Make functional, not optimal
• Let usage expose real problems

Phase 2: Find real problems
• "Users are confused by navigation" (not "might be slow later")
• Validated pain (not theoretical issues)

Phase 3: Optimize what matters
• Fix proven problems
• Ignore hypothetical ones

Pattern across contexts:

❌ Founders build scalability before validating workflows
❌ Teams optimize pricing before finding product-market fit
❌ Engineers micro-optimize code before requirements stabilize

Same pattern: polishing before validation.

Ship fast enough to learn what perfect means.
Optimize based on evidence, not fear.

What are you polishing that users haven't validated?
