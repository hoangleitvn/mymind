58% of engineering time is wasted on "work about work."
Status updates. Tool switching. Endless meetings.

Most teams add more meetings when things get unclear.
But more meetings don’t mean more progress.

Modern engineering is about reducing friction so engineers can do what they do best: build.

What makes the difference?
- Async updates with context
- Clear response times
- Respect for other people’s time
- Writing things down, not just talking about them
- Using the right tools (Jira/Linear for tasks, Slack/Teams for quick updates, reminders when needed)

Fewer meetings. More clarity. Better flow.

That’s what we mean by a communication-first culture: default to async, write clearly, and communicate with intent.

Respect time. Increase clarity. Reduce noise.

👉 What’s one meeting you could replace with an async update?
