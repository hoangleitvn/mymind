Software architecture isn't a job title.

It's a mindset.

Many developers think architecture is someone else's job. "We have an architect for that." "I just write code."

This thinking creates problems.

Every developer makes architecture decisions daily:
→ How you split code into modules
→ Where you put business logic
→ How components communicate
→ What dependencies you introduce
→ How data flows through the system

That's architecture. You're already doing it.

The question is: are you doing it intentionally?

Signs you're thinking architecturally:
✓ You ask "what happens when this grows 10x?"
✓ You consider how changes affect other parts
✓ You think about who maintains this code next
✓ You choose simple until complexity is proven necessary

Signs you're not:
✗ Copy-paste without understanding structure
✗ Add dependencies without considering coupling
✗ Build features without thinking about boundaries
✗ "It works" is the only success criteria

You don't need an Architect title.

You need to think: "What structure makes this system easy to change, test, and scale?"

Start small. A single module. One API boundary. One clear separation.

Architecture isn't about big diagrams or fancy patterns.

It's about making intentional decisions about structure.

Every level. Every day.
