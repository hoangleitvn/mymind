Everyone on my team "knows" best practices.

But after 3 weeks on a new project, we had 10 different patterns for the same feature, database migrations breaking production, and git history that looked like a crime scene.

Here's what went wrong:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Week 1:

PM: "Developers say Liquibase is new to them."
Me: "But we covered this in onboarding?"
PM: "They don't remember. It's not clear."

Week 2:

Everything inconsistent.
Standards existed on paper.
Nobody followed them.

Week 3:

PM: "We're 2 weeks behind. Standards are slowing us down."
Me: "No. LACK of standards is slowing us down."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The reality check

Knowing ≠ Applying

Our team knew:
→ GitFlow best practices
→ Database migration patterns
→ Code review standards
→ Architecture principles

But they didn't apply them.

Why?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem 1: Knowledge scattered

Best practices lived in:
→ Someone's head
→ Old Confluence pages
→ Slack threads from 6 months ago

Not documented. Not accessible. Not enforced.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem 2: No definition of done

"Is this PR ready?"

10 developers = 10 different answers.

What's "done"?
→ Tests written?
→ Docs updated?
→ Code reviewed?
→ Deployed to staging?

Nobody knew. Everyone guessed.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem 3: Standards without context

"Use Repository pattern."

But why? When? How?

Developers either:
→ Blindly followed rules they didn't understand
→ Invented their own interpretation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem 4: Tribal knowledge

Senior dev knows the patterns.
Junior dev doesn't.

No knowledge transfer.
No documentation.
No consistency.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Then came AI coders

Vibe coding made it worse.

Speed without structure = organized chaos.

AI generates code fast.

But AI doesn't know:
→ Your team's patterns
→ Your architecture decisions
→ Your naming conventions
→ Your quality standards

Result?

More code. More inconsistency. More technical debt.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The breaking point

3 months in:
→ 2 weeks behind schedule
→ Technical debt accumulating
→ Team frustration high
→ PM losing confidence

Something had to change.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The real question

This is where it gets interesting.

Some teams solve this with:
→ Architecture Decision Records
→ Strict Definition of Done
→ Documented patterns
→ Automated enforcement

Others say: "Standards slow us down. We need to move fast."

Both can't be right.

Or can they?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What I learned

MVP ≠ Features

MVP = Clarity + Stability

Not features. Not speed.

Clarity means everyone knows the standards.
Stability means standards are followed consistently.

Speed comes after.

But that's just my experience with 20+ client projects.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CTOs and engineering leaders:

How are you handling this in 2025?

Are you:
→ Enforcing strict standards (what works?)
→ Staying flexible and fast (how do you maintain quality?)
→ Found a middle ground (what does it look like?)

With AI coding accelerating everything, what's your approach?

I'm genuinely curious. Drop your experience below.
