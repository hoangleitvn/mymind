Team leadership isn't about being the best individual contributor.
It's about unlocking the best in your team.

I learned this the hard way after 15 years building teams.

The best leaders I know:
- Ask more questions than they answer
- Create space for others to grow
- Build systems, not dependencies
- Lead by example, not authority

Your job isn't to have all the answers.
Your job is to create an environment where the team finds them.

What's one thing you do to unlock your team's potential?
