Vibe coding is perfect for getting an idea off the ground:
✔ Hackathons
✔ Pitch demos
✔ Quick MVP validation
✔ Internal tools / one-off scripts
✔ Learning and experimentation
✔ Hobby apps

But here’s where it fails:
 ❌ Scaling to thousands of users
 ❌ Onboarding new developers
 ❌ Maintaining security & compliance

Many founders vibe code their MVPs… and it works. Until it doesn’t.
Then the real cost shows up: rewrites, delays, and lost opportunities.

My take:
👉 Use vibe coding to start momentum.
👉 Use structured engineering to sustain it.

What’s your experience? Did vibe coding help you or hurt you in the long run?
