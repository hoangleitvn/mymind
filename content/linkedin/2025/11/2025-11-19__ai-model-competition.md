Benchmark chasing is killing your engineering velocity.

4 major releases in 3 weeks:
Cursor 2.0, GPT-5.1, Gemini 3, Antigravity.

Each promises benchmark superiority.
Each creates migration cost.

**Gemini 3 claims:**
- 1M token context (64k output)
- Pricing: $2/$12 (<200k), $4/$18 (>200k)
- 30% better tool use vs Gemini 2.5 Pro
- 20% coding gain, 15% world knowledge gain
- 6x screen understanding improvement

**Market reality:**
Claude Sonnet 4.5 remains strongest agentic coding despite lower benchmark scores.

**The architectural trap:**

Benchmark optimization ≠ Workflow optimization
Tool switching cost > Workflow optimization ROI

Case study: PHP
Decades of "dead language" predictions.
Survives via optimized systems, stable workflows, proven value delivery.

**Technical decision framework:**

1. Measure current system baseline (velocity, quality, cost)
2. Quantify migration cost (integration time, training, workflow disruption)
3. Measure optimization ROI (actual productivity gains, not benchmark scores)
4. Switch condition: Migration ROI > Optimization ROI

Benchmark chasing creates migration cost. Workflow optimization creates compounding returns

How do you decide when to switch tools vs optimize what you have?
