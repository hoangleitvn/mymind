I tested 5+ AI tools for 6 months.

ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Cursor, and Claude Code.

Here's my setup after consolidating to Claude Code:

5 DECISIONS THAT IMPROVED MY WORKFLOW

1. Terminal-First

CLI > Desktop > Web for development work.

Why? No context switching. Stay in flow state.

Claude Code runs where you code. Your terminal.

2. Project-Level MCPs Only

Global MCPs eat context windows fast.

My rule: Start with --mcp-config only when needed. Most sessions? No MCP.

Skills handle 80% of my needs with better token efficiency.

3. Workspace Separation

3 workspaces:
- Operation/Biz Strategy - Planning, analysis, content
- Exploration - Learning new tools, experimenting
- Building - Active development projects

Each has its own .claude/ config. No mixing concerns.

4. Markdown Everything

Word docs → Markdown.
PDFs → Markdown (via markitdown).
Notes → Markdown.

Why? Metadata via frontmatter. Version control. AI-friendly format.

5. Skills Over Prompts

I spent months writing "perfect prompts."

Waste of time.

Skills = reusable, consistent, shareable workflows.

Build once. Use forever.

THE CUSTOM GPT PROBLEM

ChatGPT ignores my GPT instructions 60% of the time.

Claude Code skills? 100% consistency.

That's why I switched.

GIT FOR EVERYTHING

GitOps saves lives. Literally saved me twice from:
- Accidentally deleting files
- AI going rogue and overwriting code

Commit often. Push regularly.

BACKUP STRATEGY

I also use Codex. When Claude sessions max out, I switch.

Tool: claude-code-switch (like kubectx for Kubernetes configs)

Never stuck without an AI assistant.

WHAT'S MISSING?

Agents. I'm not using them yet or deeply customize it, I let's Claude handles it with my prompts.

Why? I want solid, repeatable workflows first.

Once I have those, agents will 10X my speed. But foundation comes first.

YOUR TURN

What's your AI tool setup? Are you consolidating or diversifying?
