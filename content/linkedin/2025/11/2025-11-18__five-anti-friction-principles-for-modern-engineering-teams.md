Most engineering teams don't fail because of bad code.
They fail because of friction.

The blueprint for modern engineering is simple: Respect time. Increase clarity. Remove blockers.

Here are 5 anti-friction principles I’ve seen transform how teams work:

1. Async communication → Protect deep work

Protect your team’s most valuable asset: Focus.

↳ Replace daily standups with short written updates in Slack or Linear/Jira.
↳ Share high-context documentation instead of relying on memory.
↳ Encourage engineers to block calendar "maker time" for uninterrupted work.
↳ Use Loom or short videos for context instead of pulling people into a call.

Result: fewer interruptions, more 3–4 hour blocks of deep coding.

2. Strategic sync vs async → Alignment without burnout

Meetings are expensive - use them carefully.

↳ Run design reviews live, but gather early feedback in a doc.
↳ Keep recurring meetings to 30 minutes, with clear pre-reads.
↳ Make retros async first; only meet live for the tough points.
↳ Save sync sessions for cross-team dependencies or culture-building.

Result: fewer hours wasted in Zoom, more alignment where it matters.

3. Impact over output → Maximize business value

Closing tickets isn’t the goal. Creating value is.

↳ Tie every story or feature to a measurable business outcome.
↳ Deprioritize work that doesn’t move a key metric.
↳ Replace "tickets closed" with success metrics like activation or retention.
↳ Give engineers context on business goals so they can challenge low-value requests.

Result: the team works on fewer things, but with greater impact.

4. Scaling habits → Increase system leverage

You can’t hire your way out of bad processes - new people inherit chaos.

↳ Write clear onboarding docs and automate local setup.
↳ Streamline sprint planning to focus on priorities, not ceremony.
↳ Standardize code review guidelines and automate basic checks.
↳ Invest in self-service playbooks for recurring ops questions.
↳ Run "habit sprints" where the only goal is to remove workflow friction.

Result: efficiency improves before new hires join and new teammates ramp faster.

5. Leaders as friction-removers → Maximize team flow

The highest-leverage leadership work is clearing drag.

↳ Step in to resolve cross-team dependency deadlocks.
↳ Automate repetitive reporting so engineers don’t waste hours.
↳ Provide context and clarity, instead of micromanaging tasks.
↳ Ask "what’s slowing you down?" in every 1:1 and act on it.

Result: leaders stop being status collectors and start being unblockers.

This is the blueprint for modern engineering. It’s what separates a busy team from a high-performing one.
