Yann LeCun is now focusing full-time on World Models.
This signals research confidence in a different AI architecture approach.

Current transformer architecture:
Input: token sequence → Output: next token prediction
Training: massive text corpus, next-token prediction
Strength: pattern matching, language generation
Limitation: sequential reasoning, no environment modeling

World Models architecture:
Input: environment state → Output: state prediction + action planning
Training: simulation environments, spatial/temporal reasoning
Strength: multi-step planning, physical world understanding
Limitation: compute cost for simulation vs. token prediction

Technical tradeoff:

Transformers optimize for: token-level pattern matching
World Models optimize for: environment-level state prediction

For AI-assisted development workflows:

Current: code completion, documentation generation, chat assistance
Limited: sequential context, pattern-based suggestions

World Models capability shift (if proven at scale):
→ Multi-file refactoring with state tracking
→ Architecture-level reasoning across system boundaries
→ Debug workflows with environment simulation

Key question: simulation cost vs. accuracy gain.

My take on what to do now:

Worth exploring and following the research.
But stay focused on current tools and workflows.

Most teams have tool sprawl problems already. Adding more MCPs creates complexity. Consider building one unified search agent instead of connecting multiple fragmented tools.

Optimize what works today before chasing what might work tomorrow.

What's your approach: explore new architectures or consolidate existing tools?
