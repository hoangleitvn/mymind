Closing tickets isn't the same as creating impact.
Too often, teams celebrate "done" without asking if it made a difference.

That’s the mindset shift modern engineering needs:
- Prioritize why, not just what
- Define success by solving problems, not closing tickets
- Value smart decisions over fast delivery
- Optimize products and processes, not just code
- Grow by enabling team outcomes, not just individual wins
- Own impact, not just tasks
- Anticipate change instead of reacting to it

How to show up today:
🔍 Seek clarity, don’t wait for it
❓ Ask better questions to uncover real needs
🧩 Scope intentionally based on outcomes
🧹 Cut wasteful “just in case” solutions
🎯 Deliver exactly what’s needed - nothing more, nothing less

It’s not about doing things right. It’s about doing the right things.

👉 How does your team make sure work delivers impact, not just output?
