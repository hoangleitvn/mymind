I watched a junior developer use ChatGPT to build a feature in 2 hours that would've taken me 6 hours five years ago.

Then I watched him spend the next 3 days debugging it.

Here's what happened:

The AI gave him perfectly formatted code. Clean interfaces. Modern patterns. Everything looked production-ready.

But the code had no error handling for edge cases. The database queries would slow to a crawl under load. Security checks were missing. The architecture didn't fit our existing system.

He couldn't see these problems because he'd never hit them before.

I could see them immediately. Not because I'm smarter. Because I've been burned by every single one.

This is the paradox we're living in right now.

Everyone has access to the same AI tools. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code. The playing field looks level.

But it's not.

AI doesn't replace experience. It amplifies it.

When I use ChatGPT, I know exactly what to ask for because I've built similar systems before. I know which parts need scrutiny. I can spot the subtle bugs in AI-generated code because I've fixed them dozens of times.

The junior developer? He's copying and pasting without the context to evaluate what he's getting.

Here's what experience gives you that AI can't:

1. Pattern recognition across projects
You've seen what breaks in production. You know which shortcuts create debt. You can predict where complexity will emerge.

2. The ability to ask better questions
Experienced developers extract more value from AI because they know what questions to ask and what context to provide.

3. Judgment on when NOT to use AI
Sometimes the old boring solution is the right one. Experience teaches you when to resist the shiny new approach.

4. Systems thinking
You understand how pieces fit together. AI gives you components. Experience tells you how to architect the whole system.

The gap between junior and senior developers isn't shrinking in the AI era.

It's widening.

AI makes experienced developers 10x more productive. It makes inexperienced developers dangerously fast.

Fast isn't the same as good. Speed without judgment creates technical debt at scale.

If you're building a team right now, here's my advice: invest in experience first, AI tools second.

The tools are getting better every day. But they're only as good as the human using them.

How are you seeing this play out on your team?
