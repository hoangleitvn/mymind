We stopped using sales decks for customer meetings.

Instead, our founders show up with Claude Code and build features live during the conversation.

It's messy. It's chaotic. And it works better than anything we've tried.

Here's what a typical customer meeting looks like now:

The founder joins with a customer. No polished slides. Just the AI coding assistant and a half-formed idea.

Customer mentions a pain point. Founder codes a solution right there. Not perfect. Not production-ready. Just enough to say "like this?"

Customer gets excited. "Wait, can it also do X?"

Founder adds it. Five minutes later, they're looking at something tangible.

The meeting ends with 10 new ideas and a working prototype, not a deck full of promises.

Then the real work begins.

Our development team doesn't get a spec document. They get:

→ A messy repo full of customer-validated concepts
→ Direct feedback from real conversations
→ Ideas that customers actually asked for

Their job isn't to translate requirements. It's to mine that chaos for insights, then combine human review with AI support to transform speed into quality.

This is where clarity gets added. Where architecture matters. Where the creative mess becomes a structured execution.

We're calling it the Creative-to-Clarity model:

1. Creative Phase: Founders + AI + customers = fast, messy validation
Live coding creates authentic reactions. You see what resonates immediately.

2. Mining Phase: Developers actively hunt for patterns in the chaos
What did customers respond to? What feedback keeps appearing? What's signal vs noise?

3. Execution Phase: Human review + AI support = structured quality
Now you add proper architecture, security, tests. Now you build it right.

The traditional model starts with clarity and hopes for customer fit.

We start with customer reactions and add clarity after we know we're building the right thing.

Speed matters in phase 1. Structure matters in phase 3. Both matter, just at different times.

This only works if your developers actively seek customer feedback instead of waiting for perfect specs. And if your founders are comfortable showing incomplete work.

But when it works, you validate faster and build with more confidence.

How are you running your team? Let's connect to share experiences and discuss what's working.
