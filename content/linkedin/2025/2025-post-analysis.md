## What Worked

### Top Performing Content Types
1. **List-based technical content** (5-10 signs/principles/rules)
   - Top 2 posts: 12,856 and 12,207 impressions
   - Clear structure drives shareability

2. **AI + Engineering intersection**
   - High engagement from tech practitioners
   - Multiple posts in top 10

3. **Practical insights over theory**
   - Posts with actionable takeaways performed 3-5x better

### Engagement Patterns
- Top posts had engagement rate of ~1% (125 engagements / 12,856 impressions)
- High-impression posts correlated with high engagements
- December spike: viral posts created compounding effect

## What Didn't Work

### Underperforming Content Types
1. **Leadership philosophy** (without technical backing)
   - Average: 300-500 impressions
   - 20x lower than technical lists

2. **Pure news/summary content**
   - Conference recaps underperformed original insight
   - Lesson: Add unique perspective, not just coverage

3. **8-month hiatus (Jan-Sep 14)**
   - Minimal posting until Sep 15 restart
   - Only 3.7% of yearly impressions from Jan-Aug

## Key Takeaways

1. **Consistency matters**: Restarted Sep 15, 3.5 months of posting = 96% of year's results
2. **List format wins**: "X signs of Y" consistently 5-10x average performance
3. **Audience is technical**: 47% IT/Software, 34% Senior level
4. **Vietnam-heavy**: 31% audience from Vietnam (HCM + Hanoi)
5. **Best days**: Sunday, Friday, Monday (avoid Saturday)
6. **Compounding effect**: +52% follower growth in 3.5 months of active posting. Ended 2026, followers at 1625.
