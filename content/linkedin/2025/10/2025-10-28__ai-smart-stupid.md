Many people have noticed something interesting when working with AI coding assistants.
They perform best when we give them autonomy and space to explore. But the more we try to control or align them tightly with what we want, the more friction appears. It suddenly feels like the AI got dumber.

It’s a bit like parenting.
When you give children freedom, they thrive. When you restrict them, they resist.

At first, you let the AI build freely, and it produces a working product fast, even if it’s rough. Then you start refining and correcting, and the process slows down. Emotions come in: frustration, impatience, disappointment. I’ve felt this too.

So what’s happening?

AI, like a child, needs context, not just commands.
If we want it to make better decisions, we need to teach it why something matters, not just what to do.

That means building a full learning environment around it:
- Clear documentation and design guidelines
- Well-written rubrics and workflows
- Context frameworks and domain knowledge graphs
- Standards and best practices tied to your architecture and process

The more context you build, the better the AI performs.
It’s not about prompting harder. It’s about teaching smarter.

A simple way to think about the AI coding journey:
Build context → Design framework → Develop skills → Iterate and improve

I am still in the first and maybe second phases of this journey.
Does anyone else feel the same?

Would love to connect and exchange ideas on how you are teaching AI assistants to code better.
