I've been exploring Amazon Q Developer lately and found some impressive new capabilities. It can now generate AWS architecture diagrams, IaC (CDK/Terraform), and even cost estimations directly from a prompt.

I wrote a quick article walking through the setup, prompts, and results (with real examples and screenshots).

If you work with AWS, DevOps, or diagram-as-code, this is worth checking out.
