Strange that Atlas isn't friendlier for older Macs.

My 2017 MacBook is old but still works. Years of files and projects make it feel like mine.

The new M series is tempting, but specs aren’t everything. Sometimes the best laptop is the one in your workflow.

I’ll upgrade when it slows down. For now, I’m sticking with it.

P.S. Maybe I’ll get an M4 for coding and tough AI tasks, not Atlas.
