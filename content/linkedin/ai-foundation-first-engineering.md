Vibe coding. AI augmented development. Agentic AI.

Everyone's talking about the future.

But here's what nobody wants to admit:

Millions of software systems were built without AI. By humans. And they're still running.

I maintain legacy projects 20+ years old:
- No documentation
- No standards
- No one who can explain the business logic
- Some files are just combined binaries we decompile to read

When we ask stakeholders about requirements, they say "read the code."

The code is messy. Outdated. Scattered across isolated components.

Leadership says the team is slow.

But the team is:
- Decompiling binary files to extract source
- Reading line by line to understand logic
- Connecting isolated systems for integration
- Fixing data inconsistencies nobody documented

If you've ever maintained a 20-year legacy system, you know this pain.

Building from scratch is easy. Maintaining it is the real engineering.

Developers love greenfield projects. They avoid the old ones.

Now add AI to the mix.

People vibe code an app in days. Ship it. Monetize. Beautiful demos.

But what happens when changes are needed?

Demo works today. Breaks at 2am when live users hit edge cases.

AI is a turbo, not a robot.

It speeds up what you already have. It doesn't replace engineering judgment.

AI with bad foundation = faster chaos.

What's missing?

Foundation.

To use AI better, you need:
- Design standards
- Best practices
- Clear rules and patterns
- Process: dev, test, validation, deployment

Without solid foundation, AI is just a painter working on a crumbling wall.

The 20% visible above water gets all the attention.

But the 80% below? That's engineering.

That's developers reading line by line.
That's architects connecting legacy systems.
That's teams fixing the mess nobody talks about.

AI makes the 20% faster.

Engineering makes the 80% possible.

Foundation first. AI second.

What's your experience with AI on legacy systems?

## User's original draft before refinement


Vibe Coding. AI Augmented Development. Vibe Engineering. Context Engineering. Agentic AI. AI Dev Team.

And lot of things people are discussing about.

But the fact is.

AI exists before but LLM or GenAI is new
Million of software built without AI - it built by human

Legacy projects 20+ year old:
No documents
No standard
No one can understand or explain it
Even some lost of codebase (just combined files)
We debug system in runtime but nocode with hope to see how does it works
and a lot of things

Asking stakeholder about the business logic
They said, read the code
But the code is messy, outdated

They said, team is slow

But they are:
Decompile combined file to get the code
Read a single line of code to understand
Connect with different isolated components and run integration
Fix data inconsistency issues
 If you ever maintain a legacy system 20+ years you will understand

Build from scratch is easy, maintain it is challenging
Dev likes new project, avoid working on old project

We have projects build with AI, some prompting, some with agents, some human read a single line of code to understand and make change

People started vibe coding -> ship app in days -> monetize -> continue the dev cycle
People ships app faster than ever before
AI generate 10x times than ever, but increase 30-40% cognitive load (security, verification debt)
Beautiful one shot prompt good UX, functional app. But what happen next if changes needed?
Everyone can create apps -> consultant firms like us has nothing todo.

Demo is just demo
Demo could works for today but broken during live users at 2am

AI as a tool that speed up (turpo) not a replacer (robot can write code). AI/LLM is an upgraded version of a computer with brain.

What is missing

Foundation

To use AI better

Build and fix foundation

Design
Standard
Best practices
Rules
Process (dev -> test -> validation -> etc.)

Without a solid foundation, AI is just painter not engineer who built the first brick of the system.


What you see is 20% on the watter
But 80% left, we, engineering (developer, engineerings) are driving the engineering, fixing systems

Yeah, this is all I talk about AI assisted development, I still see values of AI in different areas
Since we are also building this.

So this is about the Shipping with Clarity

Message To Engineer

Learn fundamentals
Don't skip basic
You learn about when buying
Build with clarity
Own your code
If you don't understand, don't ship it
Be curious
Be human

Message To Leader / Founder

Don't see 20% on the water, talk to your team, understand their pain point, help them unlock it
Don't add tool with hope can 10x your engineer speed -> buy tool is easy, but how to train your team use tool with better results talk more time that you think
Remove friction, build foundation -> then speed will come
