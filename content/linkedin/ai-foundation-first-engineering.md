Vibe coding. AI augmented development. Agentic AI.

Everyone's talking about the future.

But here's what nobody wants to admit:

Millions of software systems were built without AI. By humans. And they're still running.

We maintain legacy projects 20+ years old:
- No documentation
- No standards
- No one who can explain the business logic
- Some files are just combined binaries we decompile to read

When we ask stakeholders about requirements, they say "read the code."

The code is messy. Outdated. Scattered across isolated components.

Leadership says the team is slow.

But the team is:
- Decompiling binary files to extract source
- Reading line by line to understand logic
- Connecting isolated systems for integration
- Fixing data inconsistencies nobody documented

If you've ever maintained a 20-year legacy system, you know this pain.

Building from scratch is easy. Maintaining it is the real engineering.

Developers love greenfield projects. They avoid the old ones.

Now add AI to the mix.

People vibe code an app in days. Ship it. Monetize. Beautiful demos.

But what happens when changes are needed?

Demo works today. Breaks at 2am when live users hit edge cases.

AI is a turbo, not a robot.

It speeds up what you already have. It doesn't replace engineering judgment.

AI with bad foundation = faster chaos.

What's missing?

Foundation.

To use AI better, you need:
- Design standards
- Best practices
- Clear rules and patterns
- Process: dev, test, validation, deployment

Without solid foundation, AI is just a painter working on a crumbling wall.

The 20% visible above water gets all the attention.

But the 80% below? That's engineering.

That's developers reading line by line.
That's architects connecting legacy systems.
That's teams fixing the mess nobody talks about.

AI makes the 20% faster.

Engineering makes the 80% possible.

Foundation first. AI second.

What's your experience with AI on legacy systems?
