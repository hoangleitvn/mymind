Issue #5 of Builds That Last is live.

Most building failures don't start with bad code. They start with skipped questions.

We wrote about the 10 questions worth asking before building anything: "Clarity Before Code."

SHOULD I BUILD AT ALL?
→ What problem am I solving?
→ Who is this for?
→ What happens if I don't build this?

SHOULD I BUILD FROM SCRATCH?
→ What already exists that could work?
→ Why did the reference choose this approach?

WHAT'S THE RIGHT SCOPE?
→ What's the simplest version that solves the problem?

HOW DO I VALIDATE?
→ How will I know it works?
→ What can break?

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I SHIP?
→ Who will maintain this after I'm done?
→ How will someone else understand this without me?

The first 5 decide if you should build at all.
The last 5 decide if what you build will last.
