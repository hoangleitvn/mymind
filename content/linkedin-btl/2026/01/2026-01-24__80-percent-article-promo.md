Issue #3 of Builds That Last is live.

Everyone posts about shipping fast. Weekend MVPs. AI demos. Apps built in a day.

Nobody posts about what comes after.

We call it the 80% Problem.

Engineers spend 16% of their week writing code. The rest? Maintenance. Understanding systems they didn't build. Keeping things running.

That's not a failure. That's engineering.

Under the surface, there's more than technical debt:
→ Documentation debt. Knowledge in heads, not docs.
→ Knowledge debt. Original team left. Nobody knows why things work.
→ Architecture debt. Quick fixes that became permanent.
→ Verification debt. Missing tests. Missing specs.
→ Process debt. Deployments that require tribal knowledge.

Each one compounds. Together, they're the invisible 80% that keeps systems running.

This issue explores:
- What maintenance actually looks like in production systems
- The 5 types of debt below the waterline
- Why AI makes foundation gaps visible faster
- What this means for your engineering career

AI is an amplifier. Good foundation? It makes you faster. No foundation? It makes your gaps visible.

Most teams don't choose the 80%. They inherit it.

Foundation first. Speed follows.
