Issue #2 of Builds That Last is live.

AI can generate working code in seconds. No-code platforms ship MVPs in a weekend. The barrier to building has collapsed.

But the barrier to building something people want hasn't changed.

We call it the Discovery Problem.

35% of startups fail because there's no market need. Not bad execution. Not wrong team. No market need.

This issue explores:
- Why the bottleneck has shifted from building to knowing what to build
- What discovery actually looks like in practice
- Why vibe-coded products feel generic (and how to avoid it)
- The "Build 20% That Matters" approach

When anyone can build anything, the differentiator is knowing what to build.
