Introducing Builds That Last.

The industry celebrates shipping fast. But there's a gap between what people post and what happens in actual production systems.

We call it the Iceberg Problem.

What you see: 20% above the water. The demos. The apps shipped in a weekend. The "everyone can build now" narrative.

What you don't see: 80% below. The maintenance. The technical debt. Engineers connecting systems that were never meant to work together. Teams spending days just to understand what the previous developer was thinking.

That 80% is where real engineering happens.

Our first article explores:
- Why teams that chase speed without foundation always hit a wall
- The AI paradox: faster code generation, higher cognitive load
- What maintenance teaches us that greenfield projects never will
- Building for the people who come after

This publication is for engineers becoming leaders and founders building technical teams.

No frameworks copied. No theory without proof. Just lessons from years of building things that had to work.

Foundation first. Speed follows.
