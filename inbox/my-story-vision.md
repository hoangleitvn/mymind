# My Story & Vision

## My Story

I started as a software engineer in 2010 and quickly learned the hard truths of "work about work" in outsourcing. Instead of waiting for permission, I led client conversations, solved problems directly, and saw how fragile projects became when ownership was missing.

In 2018, I founded INNOMIZE with one goal: build with accountability, not hourly excuses. Today, we help founders and companies launch real products fast, acting as the technical owner (CTO/VP Eng) when needed, and embedding the foundations from day one so teams can focus 90% on business logic, not scaffolding.

What this means for you: if you're a founder with an idea, or a company stuck between vision and execution, I can help you go from zero to live users with speed, compliance, and focus. No vaporware, no endless delays, just outcomes.

## About Me

👤 **Who I Am**

I'm the Co-Founder & CTO of INNOMIZE, an offshore software development and IT consulting company based in Vietnam. With 12+ years in software engineering, cloud computing, and system integration, I've grown from a hands-on developer to a Solution Architect and technology leader. I bridge vision and execution, making sure projects are both technically sound and business-aligned.

🎯 **What I Do**

- Architect SaaS platforms – Build reusable frameworks like Mizestack to accelerate new product launches.
- Modern engineering – Deliver scalable, secure, and cost-optimized solutions on AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, and Dapr.
- Lead with accountability – Founded INNOMIZE on the principle of "build with accountability, not hourly excuses."
- Mentor & grow teams – Set coding standards, coach engineers, and shape a culture of engineering excellence.
- Support growth – Partner with clients from presales to delivery, ensuring clarity in contracts, proposals, and outcomes.
- Drive architecture decisions – Research and guide teams on clean architecture, domain-driven design, and NFR practices.

💡 **My Interests**

- Tech & innovation – AI/GenAI platforms, vibe/intent-driven coding, SaaS frameworks, domain-oriented architecture.
- Design & UX – Building reusable design systems with Tailwind, Shadcn UI, and design tokens.
- Business growth – Exploring outsourcing models, B2B lead generation, and global partnerships.
- Leadership & culture – Mentorship, training programs, and promoting curiosity, boldness, and accountability.
- Engineering process – Nx monorepos, coding standards, DevEx practices, and outcome-driven delivery.

🌱 **My Values**

- Outcome over output – Success is measured by results, not activity.
- Transparency & simplicity – Keep communication clear and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Continuous learning – Stay curious, experiment, and adopt new tools and practices.
- Build to last – Favor clean architecture, scalability, and long-term maintainability.
- Human connection – Collaboration and trust sit at the heart of every successful project.

⚙️ **My Preferences**

- Work style – Clear, structured communication.
- Delivery – Ship early, iterate often, refine with feedback.
- Tone – Short, friendly, professional in conversations and posts.
- Estimation – Hours, not story points.
- Organization – Capture knowledge systematically with structured notes and templates.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

### 💪 Strengths

- **Technical depth with breadth** – Strong foundation in software engineering, architecture, and cloud, with the ability to connect business and technical needs.
- **Builder mindset** – Able to create reusable frameworks (e.g. Mizestack) that accelerate product delivery and set strong foundations.
- **Accountability** – Known for outcome-focused leadership, ensuring clarity in contracts, proposals, and project delivery.
- **Mentorship & culture** – Invest in people, shaping engineering practices, training programs, and a culture of curiosity and excellence.
- **Systematic thinker** – Organize work into structured frameworks (Clean Architecture, Nx monorepos, NFR checklists) and promote scalable patterns.
- **Client engagement** – Comfortable in presales, proposals, and negotiations, bridging technical and business conversations.

### ⚠️ Weaknesses

- **Perfectionist tendency** – Sometimes spend too much time refining architecture or standards instead of shipping faster.
- **Context switching** – Balancing CTO-level vision, presales, and hands-on technical work can cause focus to fragment.
- **Delegation** – At times prefer to solve complex problems myself instead of trusting others to experiment and fail safely.
- **Over-structuring** – Desire for clean frameworks and systematic approaches can slow down in early exploration or MVP stages.
- **Patience with ambiguity** – Prefer clarity and structure, which makes messy or undefined problem spaces uncomfortable.

# Quotes, Sayings & Idioms

## Tech vs Business - MVP

Stop asking: *"Is this the best structure?"*

Start asking: *"Does this get us closer to market dominance faster?"*

"Ugly but working" > "Perfect but invisible."

Architecture is not about making everything perfect. It's about knowing **when to design for the future** and **when to ship for the present**.

## Core Principles

- **Ship early**: Simplify and ship smaller.
- **Build with users**: Listen carefully and understand their problems.
- **Know what good looks like**: Find and create good things. Point out what needs to change to make it better.
- **Think in principles**: Not in playbooks.
- **Build things that last**: Put care into the foundation. Don't make it a future person's problem.
- **Avoid side quests**: Don't fix every problem. Avoid adding unnecessary process or documents.
- **Say it as it is**: Get to the point and assume good intentions.
- **Keep the team small, do more with less**: We build better with fewer people. Wear multiple hats.
- **Hire the best people**: The best people hire the best people. Help recruit.
- **Create fans**: Build a community of people who use, love, and defend the product.

## Product

- Build 20% what matter and let customers share 80% left later → build what customers actually want
- Sign up kill the new users onboarding → guest/trial mode
