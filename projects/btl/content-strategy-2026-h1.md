# BTL Content Strategy - H1 2026

## Vision

**BTL Positioning:** Practical engineering wisdom from 15 years of building.

**Differentiation:**
- Neo Kim, Alex Xu → System design theory
- BTL → What we actually built and learned (practice)

## Content Pillars

| Pillar | Focus | Example Topics |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Foundation** | Philosophy, principles | Foundation-first, 80% below water, building to last |
| **Building** | Discovery, product, shipping | 10 questions, validation, MVP traps |
| **Leadership** | Teams, decisions, scaling | Hiring, productivity blockers, knowing-applying gap |
| **Systems in Practice** | Architecture at INNOMIZE | DevSecOps, o11y, platform eng, serverless, lessons |

## 6-Month Arc

```
PHASE 1: ESTABLISH (Issues 1-8)
"Here's what BTL believes and why it matters"

PHASE 2: PROVE (Issues 9-16)
"Here's what we've actually built and learned"

PHASE 3: SCALE (Issues 17-24)
"Here's how to apply this at team/org level"
```
