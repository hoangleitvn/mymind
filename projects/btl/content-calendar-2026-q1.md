- Team insight challenges their assumptions
- Knowing-Applying Gap goes deeper on leadership
- Personal evolution story creates connection
- Together they answer: "Can I apply this? What's the journey?"

**Issues 9-12 (Systems):**

**#4 - The AI Paradox: Why More Tools Won't Save You**
Comprehensive AI analysis combining multiple moments:
1. THE SHIFT: AI as turbo not robot, 10x generation + 30-40% cognitive load
2. THE COLLAPSE: Documentation collapse (SO: 200k→4k), knowledge drain, the "why gap"
3. THE PARADOX: Collective action problem, no incentive for AI companies to fix
4. THE RESPONSE: Build your own context, fundamentals > tools, quality > quantity
5. WHAT'S NEXT: Not predictions but preparation, skills that endure

**#5 - 10 Questions Before Building Anything**
Practical framework. Questions to ask before coding. Prevents the "we built the wrong thing" problem.

**#6 - Your Team Doesn't Need Faster Coding**
The 6 real productivity blockers. Architecture, communication, systems thinking, problem-solving, AI training, validation. Buying tools is easy, training is hard.

**#7 - The Knowing-Applying Gap**
Why teams don't do what they know. Knowledge ≠ application. The uncomfortable gap between best practices and daily reality.

| Type | Path |

**#8 - From Doing to Directing**
Personal evolution story. Overnight coding → leadership → AI workflows. How the job changed, what stayed the same.

| LinkedIn draft | `content/linkedin/2026/01/2026-01-09__founder-coding-evolution.md` |

**#9 - The First Question Before Architecture**
Before diving into architecture patterns, start with one question: "What problem are we actually solving?" Architecture without clarity is complexity theater.
