# Building Is Easy, Discovery Is Hard

Everyone ships fast. Few build to last.

AI tools generate working code in seconds. No-code platforms let non-technical founders ship MVPs in a weekend. Vibe coding turns ideas into deployable apps before lunch.

I use these tools every day. The productivity gains are real.

Here's what I keep seeing: founders shipping faster than ever, then wondering why nobody uses what they built.

The code works fine. The problem is they skipped the hard part.

## The Hard Part

Most advice about building products focuses on the building.

Ship faster. Iterate quickly. Move fast and break things.

That advice made sense when building was the bottleneck. When you had to hire engineers, wait months for development, spend serious money before knowing if anyone wanted your product.

The bottleneck has shifted.

> Discovery is the hard part now.

Discovery is the work of figuring out what to build before you build it. Understanding what users actually need. Validating that your solution solves a real problem. Testing assumptions before writing code.

This work isn't glamorous. It doesn't look like progress. You can't demo a conversation with a potential user. You can't show investors a spreadsheet of interview notes.

So most founders skip it.

They go straight from idea to code. From problem to solution. From **wouldn't it be cool if...** to shipping.

Then they wonder why their product feels generic. Why it looks like everything else.

## What 80% Failure Taught Me

A few weeks ago, I sat down with a partner we've worked with for over a decade to plan 2026.

We did the math. Of all our projects together, 80% failed.

Not because of bad code. Not because of talent. Not even because of bad ideas.

The pattern was the same every time. MVP finished, launched, ran for a month or two, then stopped. Project shutdown after weeks or months. Ideas that seemed strong, built well, but never found users.

After 15 years in consulting, we know how to ship. That's not the problem. The problem is knowing what's worth building.

This isn't unique to us. I've seen the same pattern across 50+ projects at INNOMIZE. Teams that could execute anything, building things nobody needed.

I see it from the vendor side too. We receive RFPs (Request for Proposal) all the time. Most of them have the same problem: an idea without details. No problem framing. No success criteria. Just **here's my concept, what's the price?**

Each vendor imagines different features. Each gives a different price. Maybe some founders use this to collect free ideas. But if you're serious about building, this approach fails. Without knowing what problem you're solving, why it matters, and what success looks like, you're not ready to ask anyone to build.

And now AI makes this problem worse.

## The Same Tools Problem

Here's an interesting pattern I've noticed.

When everyone uses the same AI tools with the same prompts, you get the same outputs.

Think about it. If you prompt Claude to **build a task management app with user authentication and team features** you'll get something that looks remarkably similar to what everyone else gets with the same prompt.

The design patterns are the same. The user flows are the same. The feature set is the same.

AI generates from patterns. When founders skip discovery and go straight to prompting, their products converge toward the average of everything AI has seen before.

This is why vibe-coded products often feel generic. They optimize for what's possible to build. The constraint should be what users actually need.

The differentiation happens before you touch code. In the discovery work.

## What Discovery Actually Looks Like

Let me be specific about what I mean by discovery.

I'm not talking about market research reports. I'm not talking about competitor analysis spreadsheets. I'm not talking about weeks of planning documents that nobody reads.

Discovery is simple. It's talking to people who have the problem you want to solve.

Here's what it looks like in practice:

**Week 1: 10 conversations**

Find 10 people who might have the problem you're trying to solve. Talk to them. Not to pitch. To listen.

Ask: ****What's the hardest part about [problem]?**
Ask: **How do you currently deal with this?**
Ask: **What have you tried that didn't work?**

Don't ask: **Would you use a product that does X?** People say yes to hypotheticals. It means nothing.

**Week 2: Pattern recognition**

Look at your notes. What do multiple people mention? What surprised you? Where were you wrong about the problem?

You'll find that your original idea was probably off. Not completely wrong, but shaped by your assumptions instead of their reality.

This is the point. Discovery corrects your assumptions before you spend weeks building on them.

**Week 3: Solution sketch**

Now you have context. Now you know what users actually struggle with, not what you imagined they struggle with.

Sketch a solution. Not in code. In words. In simple wireframes. In a doc you can show to the same people you interviewed.

Get their reaction. **Does this solve the problem you described?**

If yes, build it. If no, adjust.

## Where Discovery Fits in the Product Journey

Most founders jump straight from idea to development. Here's the full journey they skip:

→ **Discovery and Validation** (2-4 weeks)
   Problem interviews, solution sketches, willingness-to-pay tests

→ **Development** (variable)
   Build the 20% that matters

→ **Launch and Early Adoption** (4-8 weeks)
   Get to first users, measure what they actually do

→ **Iteration and Growth** (ongoing)
   Adjust based on real usage, not assumptions

→ **Maintenance and Evolution** (80% of product lifetime)
   The invisible work that keeps things running

Most advice focuses on steps 2-5. But step 1 determines whether the rest matters at all.

According to [CB Insights research](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/), 42% of startups fail because there's no market need. Not bad execution. Not wrong team. No market need.

That's a discovery problem, not a development problem.

## Why Founders Skip Discovery

This feels slow. Three weeks before writing code? Most founders can't tolerate that.

I understand why. I've done it myself.

**It doesn't feel like progress.** You can't show your investors a demo after a week of user interviews. You can't update your LinkedIn with **shipped a conversation.**

**It's uncomfortable.** Talking to strangers about their problems requires vulnerability. You might learn your idea is wrong. That's scary.

**Building is more fun.** Coding gives you immediate feedback. Something works or it doesn't. User research is messy and ambiguous.

**Everyone else is shipping.** You see competitors launching products every week. You feel behind. The pressure to build is overwhelming.

All of these feelings are valid. And all of them lead to the same place: products that nobody uses.

But here's what I've seen across 50+ projects:

The teams that spend a week talking to users before coding ship something different. Something that solves a problem users actually have. Something that people use.

The teams that jump straight to building ship something that looks like everything else. They ship fast, then spend months iterating toward product-market fit they could have validated upfront.

Which is actually faster?

## The Build 20% That Matters Framework

Here's a framework I use with teams.

Most products have way too many features. Founders add things because they can, not because users need them.

The question is **what 20% actually matters?**

After discovery, you should be able to answer: what is the one core thing this product does that users desperately need?

Not five things. Not a feature comparison matrix. One thing.

Build that. Ship it. See if people use it.

If they do, you have something. Add the next most important thing.

If they don't, you learned early. Before you built the other 80%.

This sounds obvious. But watch how most products launch. They ship with 20 features because vibe coding made it easy to add them. Now they have a cluttered app that's hard to explain and harder to maintain.

The discipline is building less. Building what matters.

## What AI Actually Changes

> AI changes the cost of building. It doesn't change what's worth building.

This is the part that most AI-optimism posts miss.

Yes, you can ship an MVP in a weekend. Yes, AI generates working code faster than any human. Yes, the barrier to building has collapsed.

But the barrier to building something people want hasn't changed at all.

Users don't care how fast you built it. They care if it solves their problem.

AI makes the building cheap. That makes the discovery more valuable, not less.

> When anyone can build anything, the differentiator is knowing what to build.

This is why I keep saying: the bottleneck has shifted to discovery.

## A Different Approach to Vibe Coding

I'm not anti-vibe coding. I use AI tools constantly. The productivity is real.

But I use them differently.

**Discovery first.** Before I prompt anything, I know what problem I'm solving and who has it.

**Constraints matter.** I give AI specific constraints based on what I learned from users. Not **build a task app.** More like **build a task app for construction managers who need to track job site issues offline.**

**Validate before you polish.** Get a rough version in front of users before you spend weeks on edge cases. Their reaction tells you if you're on the right track.

**Understand what it generates.** AI is a tool, not a replacement for understanding. If you can't explain how your product works, you can't improve it when users tell you what's wrong.

This is vibe coding with foundation. Building fast, but building the right thing.

## The Question That Matters

Every founder I work with eventually asks: **How do I build faster?**

I think that's the wrong question now.

The right question is: **How do I know what's worth building?**

When you answer that question, building becomes easy. You have context. You have constraints. You have a clear problem to solve.

When you skip that question, building becomes a treadmill. You ship fast, iterate endlessly, and wonder why you're not getting traction.

Discovery is the hard part. But it's also the part that makes everything else work.

## Discovery in Enterprise

This isn't just for startups.

I've seen the same pattern in enterprise. Internal tools built because someone thought they were needed. Workflows automated that nobody asked for. **Productivity improvements** that sit unused.

Enterprise teams have the same problem, often worse. Larger budgets mean more resources wasted on wrong bets. Internal customers are harder to interview because they're busy. Success metrics are unclear.

If your team builds internal tools, discovery applies. Talk to the people who will use it. Watch how they work today. Understand what actually frustrates them.

The 10-conversation framework works the same way. Just point it at internal stakeholders instead of customers.

## Start Here

If you're building something right now, try this:

1. Stop coding for one week.
2. Talk to 10 people who might have the problem you're solving.
3. Write down what surprised you.
4. Adjust your product based on what you learned.
5. Then build.

> This feels slow. It's faster than building the wrong thing twice.

Everyone can build now. The builders who win are the ones who know what to build.

That's what discovery gives you.

## Where I Am Now

Full disclosure: I'm in discovery mode myself.

I'm building something for founders and tech leaders. Right now, I'm talking to people, testing assumptions, figuring out what actually matters. Taking my own advice.

I'll share what I learn as I go. The wins and the wrong turns.

Next week: **The 80% Nobody Talks About** discover gets you to the right product. But what happens after you ship? Most of a product's life is maintenance. That's the part nobody wants to discuss.

*What's your approach to validating ideas before building? Have you ever built something you thought users wanted, only to find out you were wrong? I'd love to hear your stories.*
