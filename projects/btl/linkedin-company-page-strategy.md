# BTL LinkedIn Company Page Strategy

Strategy for the Builds That Last LinkedIn company page.

## Purpose

BTL LinkedIn company page serves as:
- **Publication presence** for Builds That Last on LinkedIn
- **Framework distribution** channel for evergreen content
- **Article promotion** for Substack content
- **Professional authority** for BTL as thought leadership publication

## Content Split: Company vs Personal

| Aspect | BTL Company Page | Personal Profile (hoangle) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Voice | Publication "we" | Personal "I" |
| Content | Evergreen frameworks, article promos | Stories, commentary, engagement |
| Tone | Educational/authoritative | Conversational/personal |
| Frequency | As-needed (irregular) | Daily (per posting strategy) |
| Purpose | Publication authority | Personal connection |

### What Goes Where

**BTL Company Page:**
- Framework posts (distilled principles)
- Substack article promos
- Evergreen principles (timeless content)
- Core BTL philosophy content

**Personal Profile:**
- Personal stories and experiences
- Timely commentary and observations
- Weekly engagement content
- Opinion and debate

## Content Types

### 1. Framework Posts

Distilled principles presented as actionable frameworks.

- **Structure:** Principle + Supporting points + Takeaway
- **Tone:** Educational, authoritative
- **When:** When there's a framework worth sharing

### 2. Article Promos

Announcements for new Substack articles.

- **Structure:** Hook + What the article covers + Link + Signature
- **Tone:** Informative, inviting
- **When:** With each Substack publish

### 3. Evergreen Principles

Timeless insights that remain relevant.

- **Structure:** Observation + Insight + Implication
- **Tone:** Wise, grounded
- **When:** When principle crystallizes

## Posting Frequency

**Cadence:** As-needed / irregular

No fixed schedule. Post when:
- New Substack article published (promo)
- Framework crystallizes clearly enough to share
- Principle worth capturing as standalone content

Quality over quantity. BTL company page is not a daily engagement channel.

## Voice & Persona

Use `persona-btl-company.md` for all BTL company page content.

**Key voice characteristics:**
- Educational/authoritative (teaching mode)
- Publication "we" (editorial voice)
- Framework-driven (structured principles)
- Evergreen focus (timeless over topical)

## Content Workflow

### For Framework Posts

1. Identify framework from moments, articles, or insights
2. Distill into clear structure (principle + points + takeaway)
3. Draft with BTL company persona
4. Store in `content/linkedin-btl/`
5. Publish when ready

### For Article Promos

1. Substack article published
2. Create promo post highlighting key insights
3. Include article link and BTL signature
4. Store in `content/linkedin-btl/`
5. Publish to company page

## Post Format

```yaml

2. BTL company page: Distill into framework
3. Substack: Deep dive article
4. Personal profile: Promo with personal angle

## Signature

End BTL company posts with:
