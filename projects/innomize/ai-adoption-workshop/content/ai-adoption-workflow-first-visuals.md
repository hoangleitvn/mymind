# Visual Concepts for AI Adoption Article

## Visual 1: The 4-Step Framework Flow

**Purpose:** Hero visual, shows the correct sequence
**Placement:** After "The Framework: Workflow First, Tools Last" heading
**Format:** Horizontal flow diagram

```
[1. WORKFLOW] → [2. SKILLS] → [3. GUARDRAILS] → [4. TOOLS]
   Map it         Build them     Design them      Then pick
```

**Design notes:**
- Left-to-right flow with arrows
- Each step as a rounded rectangle or circle
- Subtle numbering (1-4)
- Color progression (darker to lighter, or brand colors)
- Caption: "The order matters. Each step builds on the previous one."

**Alternative:** Vertical stack for mobile-first


## Visual 2: The 5 Skills

**Purpose:** Make skills memorable and scannable
**Placement:** Within "Step 2: Define the Skills" section
**Format:** Icon grid or vertical list with icons

```
[Icon] Problem Framing     → Turn vague into testable
[Icon] Decomposition       → Split into verifiable steps
[Icon] Evaluation          → Know good before you see output
[Icon] Correction          → Fix the 20%, don't regenerate
[Icon] Systems Thinking    → Make it easier next time
```

**Icon suggestions:**
- Problem Framing: Target/bullseye
- Decomposition: Puzzle pieces or layers
- Evaluation: Checkmark/scale
- Correction: Pencil/edit
- Systems Thinking: Gears/cycle

**Design notes:**
- Consistent icon style (line icons or filled)
- Brief tagline for each skill
- Could be a 5-column row or 2x3 grid


## Visual 3: The 4-Week Adoption Timeline

**Purpose:** Make the practical plan visual and actionable
**Placement:** Within "A Practical Adoption Plan" section
**Format:** Timeline or horizontal roadmap

```
Week 1          Week 2          Week 3          Week 4
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CHOOSE & MAP    TRAIN SKILLS    AUTOMATE        REVIEW & EXPAND
                                THE BORING

• Select one    • Problem       • Introduce     • Assess results
  workflow        framing         AI            • Refine guardrails
• Map current   • Decomposition • Apply         • Choose next
  state         • Evaluation      guardrails      workflow
• Define done                   • Humans on
                                  decisions
```

**Design notes:**
- Clean timeline with week markers
- Key activities bulleted under each week
- Progress arrow or gradient showing momentum


## Visual 4: Warning Signs Checklist

**Purpose:** Quick diagnostic for readers
**Placement:** Within "Warning Signs" section
**Format:** Checklist or red-flag icons

```
⚠️ Quality complaints increase after AI introduction
⚠️ "AI made a mistake" becomes an excuse
⚠️ Nobody can explain validation process
⚠️ Tool switching every few months
⚠️ Shadow AI emerges
```

**Design notes:**
- Warning icon (triangle with !) for each item
- Checkbox style for self-assessment
- Red/orange accent color
- Could include "If you see 2+ of these, workflow is the problem"


## Visual 5: Tools-First vs Workflow-First Comparison

**Purpose:** Contrast the two approaches clearly
**Placement:** Could be in "Why Tools-First Fails" or summary
**Format:** Two-column comparison

```
TOOLS-FIRST                    WORKFLOW-FIRST
───────────────────────────────────────────────
❌ Pick tool first             ✓ Map workflow first
❌ Train on interface          ✓ Build human skills
❌ Hope for quality            ✓ Design guardrails
❌ React to problems           ✓ Prevent problems
❌ Months of evaluation        ✓ Days to select tools
```

**Design notes:**
- Red (X) vs Green (checkmark)
- Side-by-side columns
- Clear contrast without being too negative


## Visual 6: The 20/80 Split (Optional)

**Purpose:** Reinforce key insight visually
**Placement:** Near "The tool is 20% of the outcome. The workflow is 80%."
**Format:** Pie chart or bar

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│████████████████████████████████████████│░░│
│            WORKFLOW (80%)              │20%│
│                                        │Tool│
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design notes:**
- Simple, bold
- Emphasize the imbalance
- Could be pie chart or horizontal bar


## Production Notes

**Style consistency:**
- Use INNOMIZE brand colors
- Clean, professional look (not playful)
- Minimal decoration, focus on information
- White/light background for web readability

**File formats needed:**
- PNG for web (2x resolution for retina)
- SVG if available (better scaling)
- Consider dark mode versions

**Tools suggested:**
- Figma for creation
- Or simple diagrams in Mermaid/Excalidraw if faster
