## Slide 4: The Shift — Why "Builder Mindset"?

### From 2024 to 2026

| 2024-2025 | 2026+ |
|-----------|-------|
| "Be the Solver, Not the Spotter" | "Be the Builder" |
| Consulting & Services | Solutions & Products |
| Vendor relationship | Strategic Partnership |
| Grow headcount | Grow impact |
| Task execution | Ownership & Initiative |

### The Question for 2026

> How do we increase revenue without increasing headcount?

**Answer:** Build smarter. Build with purpose. Build things that last.

---

## Slide 5: The Honest Conversation

### What I Observed in 2025

_(Based on 1:1 conversations across the team)_

| What I See | What We Need |
|------------|--------------|
| Waiting for tasks | Taking initiative |
| "Em muốn..." (I want) | "Em sẽ..." (I will) |
| Asking "What's my task?" | Asking "What should exist?" |
| Blaming circumstances | Owning outcomes |
| Following habits | Acting with purpose |
| Silent in discussions | Proposing solutions |

### The Core Issue

> Tất cả đều chỉ là mong muốn—"tôi muốn, em muốn"—nhưng không có hành động cụ thể.
>
> _(Everything is just wishes—"I want"—but no concrete actions.)_

**This is not a skills problem. This is a mindset problem.**

---

## Slide 6: 2026 Vision — Builder Mindset

### What is a Builder?

| Task-Taker | Builder |
|------------|---------|
| Waits for instructions | Seeks to understand the system |
| Does what's assigned | Asks "What problem are we solving?" |
| Reacts to problems | Anticipates and prevents |
| "I don't know" = stop | "I don't know" = go find out |
| Dependent on others | Independent, then collaborative |
| No opinion in discussions | Proposes, debates, commits |

### Builder's Question

> "Nếu đây là công ty của mình, mình sẽ làm gì?"
>
> _(If this were my company, what would I do?)_

---

## Slide 7: Three Pillars for 2026

### OWN • BUILD • LEAD

---

## Slide 8: Pillar 1 — OWN

### Take Ownership Before You're Asked

**Mindset Shift:**
- From "waiting for task" → "what should I learn/do next?"
- From "I don't know what I don't know" → "I will find out what I don't know"
- From blaming (company, circumstances, others) → owning your growth

**Behaviors:**
- Understand the system before you're asked
- Raise issues before they become problems
- Ask for help, don't wait to be rescued
- Have a plan, not just wishes

**Question to Ask Yourself:**
> "Hiện tại em đã làm gì để hiểu được hệ thống? Hay chỉ đợi có task thì mới tìm hiểu?"
>
> _(What have you done to understand the system? Or do you only learn when there's a task?)_

---

## Slide 9: Pillar 2 — BUILD

### From Tasks to Solutions

**Business Shift:**
- Consulting → Building (solutions, products)
- Vendor → Strategic Partner
- Hours sold → Value delivered

**Engineering Focus:**

| Area | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Foundation** | Solid fundamentals before speed |
| **Architecture** | Intentional decisions, not accidents |
| **Quality** | Build it right, not just fast |
| **Systems Thinking** | Understand the whole, not just your part |

**The Builder's Standard:**
> "Clients don't need hands. They need minds."

---

## Slide 10: Pillar 3 — LEAD

### Lead Yourself First

**Self-Leadership:**
- Work with purpose, not just habit
- Make decisions, don't wait for permission
- Communicate proactively—don't be silent
- Have a vision for your own growth

**Leadership Build-Up:**
- Growth mindset over fixed mindset
- Lead with vision and purpose
- Strategy discussions need your voice

**The Leadership Question:**
> "Anh không thấy ai có ý kiến gì hết, không đề xuất."
>
> _(I don't see anyone with opinions, no proposals.)_

**In 2026, silence is not neutral. Silence is falling behind.**

---

## Slide 11: What This Means for Engineering

### Foundation-First Engineering

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Foundation** | Master fundamentals before frameworks |
| **Architecture** | Design intentionally, document decisions |
| **Mindset** | Curious, proactive, ownership |
| **Leadership** | Technical leadership at every level |
| **Vision** | Understand the "why" behind the code |

### The Standard

> "Architecture is a decision, not an accident."

---

## Slide 12: Revenue Without Headcount

### How Builders Create More Value

| Lever | How |
|-------|-----|
| **Efficiency** | Better systems, less rework |
| **Quality** | Build right the first time |
| **Products** | Reusable solutions, not one-off projects |
| **Partnerships** | Strategic value, not just hours |
| **AI & Automation** | Multiply output, not just effort |

### The Math

> Same team + Builder Mindset = More impact

### What Builders Do Every Day

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Understand** the system you work on | Don't wait for tasks to learn |
| **Ask** questions before you're stuck | Independence ≠ isolation |
| **Propose** solutions, not just problems | Have an opinion |

### The Builder's Daily Question

> "Hôm nay mình đã xây được gì?"
>
> _(What did I build today?)_

## Slide 16: The Challenge

### To Every Team Member

> Năm 2025, nhiều người trong chúng ta đang chờ, chờ task, chờ hướng dẫn, chờ ai đó quyết định.
>
> Năm 2026, chúng ta cần người xây dựng, không phải người chờ đợi.
>
> _(In 2025, many of us were waiting, waiting for tasks, waiting for instructions, waiting for someone to decide. In 2026, we need builders, not waiters.)_

### The Question for You

> "Nếu đây là công ty của mình, mình sẽ làm gì khác?"
>
> _(If this were your company, what would you do differently?)_

---

## Notes for Presenter

### Key Transitions to Emphasize

1. **Solver → Builder**: This is the natural evolution. Solvers fix what's broken. Builders create what should exist.

2. **The honest conversation**: Don't shy away from the 1:1 observations. Frame it as growth opportunity, not criticism.

3. **Revenue without headcount**: This isn't about doing more with less—it's about doing better with what we have.

4. **Engineering excellence**: Foundation, architecture, mindset—these enable everything else.

### Potential Discussion Points

- Ask team members: "What would you do if this were your company?"
- Share specific examples of builder behavior vs. task-taker behavior
- Connect individual growth to company growth

### Slides to Customize

- Slide 2: Add 2025 specific achievements
- Slide 3: Add actual assessment of 2025 goals
- Slide 15: Add specific 2026 metrics and targets
