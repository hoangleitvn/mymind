XTND PlatformDevelopment Partnership Economic ScheduleEffective Date: January 5, 2026Parties: XTND Technologies, Inc. (“XTND”) and Innomize Co., LTD. (“Partner”)This Development Partnership Economic Schedule (“Economic Schedule”) is entered into pursuant to, and is governed by, the Independent Contractor Agreement between the parties dated January 1, 2026 (the “ICA”). Except as expressly set forth herein with respect to pricing, revenue participation, and economic terms, all services performed under this Economic Schedule shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the ICA. In the event of any conflict between this Economic Schedule and the ICA, the ICA shall control.1. Scope of WorkPartner will provide engineering, quality assurance, and DevOps resources to support the XTND Platform, including:* Migration of an existing platform to a new scalable, multi-tenant architecture* Architectural enhancements* Workflow and integration updates* Stabilization and hypercare post-launchThis work is product platform development, not client delivery or staff augmentation.For clarity, the reduced blended rate applies solely to XTND Platform build activities related to core product development. Customer-specific implementation or operational services are excluded from the platform build scope unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing.Platform Architecture ClarificationFor the avoidance of doubt, the XTND Platform is a single, modular, multi-tenant platform architecture.Product names such as Juniper, Juniper+, etc., and similar offerings represent functional modules within the XTND Platform, not standalone or independently deployed systems.Module prioritization and sequencing may evolve over time and does not alter the scope or economic structure of this Agreement unless expressly agreed in writing.2. Team Composition (Initial Phase)The initial team allocation will consist of up to the following resources:* Senior Full-Stack Engineers: 3* Mid-Level Full-Stack Engineers: 4* Junior Full-Stack Engineers: 2* Senior QA Engineer: 1* Junior QA Engineer: 1* DevOps Engineer: 1Total resources: 12Adjustments to team composition may be made by mutual agreement.Resource Allocation & Governance* Resources assigned under this Agreement are expected to be primarily dedicated to XTND Platform development during active phases.* XTND acknowledges that limited shared utilization may occur, provided such sharing does not materially impact delivery commitments.* Primary technical point of contact on XTND side: initially Ben Elliott, or such successor as XTND may designate in writing.Day-to-day coordination, backlog prioritization, and sprint execution will follow mutually agreed Agile practices.
3. Hours & PhasesPhase 1 — Core Build (Months 1–4)* Target allocation: ~150 hours per resource per month* Objective: Fully functional XTND Platform on new architecturePhase 2 — Hypercare & Stabilization (Months 5–6)* Target allocation: ~90 hours per resource per month* Objective: Bug fixes, performance tuning, operational hardeningHours are targets for planning and budgeting purposes and may vary slightly month to month.4. Schedule AdjustmentsIf the core build phase extends beyond Month 4 by more than forty-five (45) days due to XTND-driven scope changes or architectural decisions, the parties agree to review the blended rate and/or Revenue Share cap in good faith to ensure continued fairness to both parties. Any such review shall not override the Extended Discount Cap Adjustment mechanism set forth below unless expressly agreed in writing.5. Blended Hourly Rate* Blended hourly rate (all roles): $16.75 USD* This rate applies exclusively to XTND Platform development work.* This rate reflects cost coverage plus minimal operating margin and is below Partner’s standard commercial rate.6. Implementation Services BillingAny implementation, onboarding, configuration, migration, training, or other customer-specific professional services performed by Partner personnel in support of the XTND Platform (“Implementation Services”) shall be billed at Partner’s then-current standard commercial rates and shall not be subject to the reduced blended rate set forth in Section 4. Implementation Services are expressly excluded from the scope of discounted platform build services and from Revenue Share consideration.For the avoidance of doubt, Partner’s standard commercial rates for Implementation Services shall be governed by the applicable rates set forth in the Independent Contractor Agreement or any written rate card mutually agreed by the parties.7. Revenue Participation (Upside Consideration)In consideration for the reduced blended rate and Partner’s early commitment to the XTND Platform, Partner will receive a revenue participation as follows:* Revenue share: 6% of gross revenue generated by the XTND Platform* Activation: Applies only to revenue actually collected by XTND* Cap: $225,000 USD total* Term: Until the Revenue Share cap is reached or thirty-six (36) months from first revenue recognition, whichever occurs first* Upon reaching the cap or term expiration, the revenue share terminates automatically with no further obligation.Extended Discount Cap AdjustmentIf XTND elects to extend XTND Platform build services beyond Month 6 at a blended rate below Partner’s then-current standard commercial rates, the Revenue Share cap shall be increased by an amount equal to two and one-half (2.5) times the aggregate discount actually provided during such extension period.For purposes of this calculation, the “discount” shall mean the difference between Partner’s standard commercial rates and the discounted rates actually billed, multiplied by the actual billable hours incurred during the applicable extension period. The Extended Discount Adjustment shall apply for a maximum of six (6) additional months beyond Month 6 unless otherwise agreed in writing.Revenue Share Payment TermsRevenue Share obligations shall commence with revenue collected on or after June 1, 2026. Revenue Share payments shall be calculated monthly and remitted to Partner within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar month, accompanied by a summary statement of Gross Revenue and applicable exclusions. “Gross Revenue” means recurring subscription or license fees collected by XTND for use of the XTND Platform, excluding taxes, refunds, credits, chargebacks, and all Excluded Revenue as defined herein.Revenue Share payments shall be made only from revenue actually received by XTND and shall not be accrued, prepaid, or guaranteed.Excluded RevenueFor the avoidance of doubt, revenue collected in connection with work performed, invoiced, or fully paid prior to the 1st day of June 2026 shall be excluded from Gross Revenue unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing.Excluded Revenue shall not be counted toward:* Revenue Share calculations, or* Satisfaction of the Revenue Share cap described in Section 5.All other revenue generated by the XTND Platform, unless expressly excluded in writing by mutual agreement of the parties, shall be included in Gross Revenue.Implementation Fees ExclusionFor the avoidance of doubt, Gross Revenue shall exclude all one-time or non-recurring implementation fees, onboarding fees, configuration fees, migration fees, training fees, or similar professional services fees (collectively, “Implementation Fees”). Implementation Fees are excluded regardless of whether such services are performed by XTND personnel or Partner personnel and shall not be subject to Revenue Share or applied toward satisfaction of the Revenue Share cap.8. Billing & Invoicing Mechanics* Platform development services shall be invoiced monthly based on actual hours worked.* Invoices shall be payable within thirty (30) days of receipt unless otherwise agreed in writing.XTND Platform development invoices and Implementation Services invoices (if any) shall be issued separately and clearly identified.9. Nature of the Arrangement* This revenue participation is not equity, not a loan, and not a guaranteed payment.* Partner bears no obligation beyond providing services under the agreed blended rate.* XTND bears no obligation to generate revenue.* This structure is intended to align incentives while preserving long-term scalability and fundability of the XTND Platform.* For the avoidance of doubt, Partner shall not receive both uncapped economic participation and full commercial rates for the same period of services, and all upside participation under this Schedule is expressly bounded as set forth herein.10. Contingent Equity Participation (Non-Voting)Subject to the terms set forth herein, XTND may grant Partner the right to receive up to zero and one-half percent (0.5%) of XTND’s fully diluted common equity on a non-voting basis, contingent upon satisfaction of the following conditions:Eligibility TriggerThe XTND Platform reaches general availability (“GA”) and serves at least one paying customer on the multi-tenant XTND Platform architecture.General Availability (“GA”) means the XTND Platform has been deployed to a production environment, is available for use by customers under standard commercial terms, and is not designated by XTND as beta, pilot, preview, or similar pre-release status. GA includes XTND’s readiness to onboard and support customers on the XTND Platform as a commercially supported product.Issuance EventAny equity issuance pursuant to this section shall occur only upon the earlier of:i. XTND’s first priced equity financing, orii. XTND achieving a mutually agreed recurring revenue milestone.VestingAny equity issued pursuant to this section shall vest over forty-eight (48) months, with vesting conditioned upon Partner’s continued material contribution to the XTND Platform during the vesting period. Vesting shall cease upon termination of services. Unvested equity shall be forfeited upon termination unless otherwise agreed in writing.GovernanceAny equity issued shall be non-voting, shall confer no board rights or protective provisions, and shall be subject to standard dilution.ClarificationThis equity participation is separate from, and not in addition to, the Revenue Share, and is intended solely to recognize long-term alignment with the XTND Platform. For the avoidance of doubt, vesting of any equity issued shall not extend, renew, or revive any Revenue Share obligations.11. Termination & Wind-DownEither party may terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days’ written notice.Upon termination:* XTND shall pay all undisputed amounts for services rendered through termination date* Partner shall reasonably assist with knowledge transfer and orderly wind-down* All XTND intellectual property, including all Platform IP and Developed Works as defined in the Independent Contractor Agreement, remains the exclusive property of XTNDTermination shall not accelerate or extend Revenue Share obligations beyond amounts already earned on revenue collected prior to termination.Transition assistance, post-termination cooperation, credential handover, and continuity obligations shall be governed by, and not limited by, the applicable provisions of the Independent Contractor Agreement.12. Future Commercial TermsFollowing completion of the initial build and hypercare phase, the parties may mutually agree to:* Transition XTND Platform work to standard commercial rates, and/or* Renegotiate ongoing support, enhancements, or operational responsibilitiesAny such changes must be documented in writing.Post-Build Commercial TransitionFollowing completion of the initial build and hypercare phases, any transition to standard commercial rates or changes to ongoing support terms shall be mutually agreed in writing. Neither party shall be obligated to continue services under materially different economic terms without such agreement.13. Good-Faith PartnershipBoth parties acknowledge that this structure is designed to:* Enable lean execution during a critical platform rebuild* Share upside in the event of product success* Limit downside risk for both parties if the platform does not scale as expected
