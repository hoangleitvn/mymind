location, and timing of performing the Services, subject only to
Corporation's right to define required outcomes, security requirements,
and Platform standards.

without Corporation\'s prior written consent. Any approved
subcontractors shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including
confidentiality, IP assignment, and data protection obligations.

Independent Contractor represents that it is a duly organized entity
under Vietnamese law and will engage its personnel as employees or
subcontractors in compliance with Vietnamese labor and civil laws.

purpose.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create an employment
relationship under the laws of the United States, Vietnam, or any other
jurisdiction.
