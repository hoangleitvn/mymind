**Effective Date:** January 5, 2026

**Parties:** XTND Technologies, Inc. ("XTND") and Innomize Co., LTD.
("Partner")

This Development Partnership Economic Schedule ("Economic Schedule") is
entered into pursuant to, and is governed by, the Independent Contractor
Agreement between the parties dated January 1, 2026 (the "ICA"). Except
as expressly set forth herein with respect to pricing, revenue
participation, and economic terms, all services performed under this
Economic Schedule shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the
ICA. In the event of any conflict between this Economic Schedule and the
ICA, the ICA shall control.

# Scope of Work

Partner will provide engineering, quality assurance, and DevOps
resources to support the XTND Platform, including:

- Migration of an existing platform to a new scalable, multi-tenant
  architecture

- Architectural enhancements

- Workflow and integration updates

- Stabilization and hypercare post-launch

This work is product platform development, not client delivery or staff
augmentation.

For clarity, the reduced blended rate applies solely to XTND Platform
build activities related to core product development. Customer-specific
implementation or operational services are excluded from the platform
build scope unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing.

## Platform Architecture Clarification

For the avoidance of doubt, the XTND Platform is a single, modular,
multi-tenant platform architecture.

Product names such as *Juniper, Juniper+, etc.,* and similar offerings
represent functional modules within the XTND Platform, not standalone or
independently deployed systems.

Module prioritization and sequencing may evolve over time and does not
alter the scope or economic structure of this Agreement unless expressly
agreed in writing.

# Team Composition (Initial Phase)

The initial team allocation will consist of up to the following
resources:

- Senior Full-Stack Engineers: 3

- Mid-Level Full-Stack Engineers: 4

- Junior Full-Stack Engineers: 2

- Senior QA Engineer: 1

- Junior QA Engineer: 1

- DevOps Engineer: 1

*Total resources: 12*

Adjustments to team composition may be made by mutual agreement.

## Resource Allocation & Governance

- Resources assigned under this Agreement are expected to be primarily
  dedicated to XTND Platform development during active phases.

- XTND acknowledges that limited shared utilization may occur, provided
  such sharing does not materially impact delivery commitments.

- Primary technical point of contact on XTND side: initially Ben
  Elliott, or such successor as XTND may designate in writing.

Day-to-day coordination, backlog prioritization, and sprint execution
will follow mutually agreed Agile practices.

# Hours & Phases

## Phase 1 --- Core Build (Months 1--4)

- Target allocation: \~150 hours per resource per month

- Objective: Fully functional XTND Platform on new architecture

## Phase 2 --- Hypercare & Stabilization (Months 5--6)

- Target allocation: \~90 hours per resource per month

- Objective: Bug fixes, performance tuning, operational hardening

Hours are targets for planning and budgeting purposes and may vary
slightly month to month.

# Schedule Adjustments

If the core build phase extends beyond Month 4 by more than forty-five
(45) days due to XTND-driven scope changes or architectural decisions,
the parties agree to review the blended rate and/or Revenue Share cap in
good faith to ensure continued fairness to both parties.

# Blended Hourly Rate

- Blended hourly rate (all roles): \$16.75 USD

- This rate applies exclusively to XTND Platform development work.

- This rate reflects cost coverage plus minimal operating margin and is
  below Partner's standard commercial rate.

# Implementation Services Billing

Any implementation, onboarding, configuration, migration, training, or
other customer-specific professional services performed by Partner
personnel in support of the XTND Platform ("Implementation Services")
shall be billed at Partner's then-current standard commercial rates and
shall not be subject to the reduced blended rate set forth in Section 4.
Implementation Services are expressly excluded from the scope of
discounted platform build services and from Revenue Share consideration.

For the avoidance of doubt, Partner's standard commercial rates for
Implementation Services shall be governed by the applicable rates set
forth in the Independent Contractor Agreement or any written rate card
mutually agreed by the parties.

# Revenue Participation (Upside Consideration)

In consideration for the reduced blended rate and Partner's early
commitment to the XTND Platform, Partner will receive a revenue
participation as follows:

- **Revenue share:** 6% of gross revenue generated by the XTND Platform

- **Activation:** Applies only to revenue actually collected by XTND

- **Cap:** \$170,000 USD total

- **Term:** Until the cap is reached or 36 months from first revenue
  recognition, whichever occurs first

- Upon reaching the cap or term expiration, the revenue share terminates
  automatically with no further obligation.

## Revenue Share Payment Terms

Revenue Share obligations shall commence with revenue collected on or
after June 1, 2026. Revenue Share payments shall be calculated monthly
and remitted to Partner within thirty (30) days following the end of
each calendar month, accompanied by a summary statement of Gross Revenue
and applicable exclusions.

Revenue Share payments shall be made only from revenue actually received
by XTND and shall not be accrued, prepaid, or guaranteed.

## Excluded Revenue

For the avoidance of doubt, revenue collected in connection with work
performed, invoiced, or fully paid prior to the 1st day of June 2026
shall be excluded from Gross Revenue unless expressly agreed otherwise
in writing.

Excluded Revenue shall not be counted toward:

- Revenue Share calculations, or

- Satisfaction of the Revenue Share cap described in Section 5.

All other revenue generated by the XTND Platform, unless expressly
excluded in writing by mutual agreement of the parties, shall be
included in Gross Revenue.

## Implementation Fees Exclusion

For the avoidance of doubt, Gross Revenue shall exclude all one-time or
non-recurring implementation fees, onboarding fees, configuration fees,
migration fees, training fees, or similar professional services fees
(collectively, "Implementation Fees"). Implementation Fees are excluded
regardless of whether such services are performed by XTND personnel or
Partner personnel and shall not be subject to Revenue Share or applied
toward satisfaction of the Revenue Share cap.

# Billing & Invoicing Mechanics

- Platform development services shall be invoiced monthly based on
  actual hours worked.

- Invoices shall be payable within thirty (30) days of receipt unless
  otherwise agreed in writing.

XTND Platform development invoices and Implementation Services invoices
(if any) shall be issued separately and clearly identified.

# Nature of the Arrangement

- This revenue participation is not equity, not a loan, and not a
  guaranteed payment.

- Partner bears no obligation beyond providing services under the agreed
  blended rate.

- XTND bears no obligation to generate revenue.

- This structure is intended to align incentives while preserving
  long-term scalability and fundability of the XTND Platform.

# Termination & Wind-Down

Either party may terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days' written
notice.

Upon termination:

- XTND shall pay all undisputed amounts for services rendered through
  termination date

- Partner shall reasonably assist with knowledge transfer and orderly
  wind-down

- All XTND intellectual property, including all Platform IP and
  Developed Works as defined in the Independent Contractor Agreement,
  remains the exclusive property of XTND

Termination shall not accelerate or extend Revenue Share obligations
beyond amounts already earned on revenue collected prior to termination.

Transition assistance, post-termination cooperation, credential
handover, and continuity obligations shall be governed by, and not
limited by, the applicable provisions of the Independent Contractor
Agreement.

# Future Commercial Terms

Following completion of the initial build and hypercare phase, the
parties may mutually agree to:

- Transition XTND Platform work to standard commercial rates, and/or

- Renegotiate ongoing support, enhancements, or operational
  responsibilities

Any such changes must be documented in writing.

## Post-Build Commercial Transition

Following completion of the initial build and hypercare phases, any
transition to standard commercial rates or changes to ongoing support
terms shall be mutually agreed in writing. Neither party shall be
obligated to continue services under materially different economic terms
without such agreement.

# Good-Faith Partnership

Both parties acknowledge that this structure is designed to:

- Enable lean execution during a critical platform rebuild

- Share upside in the event of product success

- Limit downside risk for both parties if the platform does not scale as
  expected**\**

**Authority to Execute.** Each party represents and warrants that it is
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction
of formation, and that the individual executing this Agreement on its
behalf has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to bind such party to its terms.
