# Email Draft: XTND Partnership Discussion

**To:** [XTND Contact]
**Subject:** Partnership Agreement - A Few Questions Before We Finalize

Hi [Name],

Thank you for sharing the partnership agreements. We've reviewed both documents and are excited about moving forward together.

Before we sign, we'd like to discuss a few points to ensure we're set up for a successful long-term partnership - not just a 6-month project.

## Questions

**1. Revenue Share Timing**
The current terms have revenue share starting June 1, 2026. Since we're starting work January 1 at discounted rates, we'd like to understand: do you expect to collect platform revenue during Jan-May? Would you consider starting revenue share from March 1, 2026? This gives you 2 months before we participate, while still aligning closer to when we begin work.

**2. Revenue Structure - Platform vs. Implementation**
The contract excludes implementation fees from revenue share. Can you help us understand:
- How do you typically structure customer contracts (platform fees vs. implementation fees)?
- What percentage of a typical customer deal is platform revenue vs. implementation?
- Who decides what counts as "implementation" vs. "platform" when onboarding a new client?
- For example, if a customer pays $100K/year, what's the typical breakdown?

**3. Revenue Projections**
Can you share projected platform revenue for the next 12 months? This helps us evaluate the partnership economics.

**4. Multi-Project Operations**
We operate as a multi-project firm serving several clients (this is how we keep rates competitive). A few clarifications:
- Is 70% dedication to XTND during build phase acceptable? We'd maintain 50% during hypercare.
- If XTND has delays or reduced scope temporarily, can we reallocate team members to other projects?
- How do you define "primarily dedicated" in practical terms?

**5. Other Client Work**
For transparency: we have ongoing commitments to other clients. Work for other clients is billed separately at our standard rates and doesn't affect your pricing or timelines. Is this arrangement acceptable?

## Suggestions

We'd like to propose a few adjustments that we believe benefit both parties:

### Rate Structure for Extensions

Your contract mentions "good faith review" if build extends past Month 4. To avoid ambiguity later, we propose defining this upfront:

- **Months 1-6:** $16.75/hr (as agreed)
- **Months 7-12:** $20.00/hr (if extended)
- **Month 13+:** $23.50/hr (ICA standard)

This gives you continued discounted rates while providing us clarity.

### Revenue Share Terms

We're taking meaningful investment risk with the discounted rate:

- **Build phase (M1-6):** 9,360 hours at $16.75 vs. $23.50 standard = **$63K discount**
- **Extended phase (M7-12):** 9,360 hours at $20.00 vs. $23.50 standard = **$33K discount**
- **Total investment (if 12 months):** **$96K** in rate discounts

This is real investment we're making in your platform's success. In exchange, we'd like to propose:

- **Start date:** March 1, 2026 (gives you 2 months before we participate)
- **Term:** 48 months at 6% (instead of 36 months capped)
- **Cap:** Remove the $170K cap

At 6% for 4 years, you keep 94% of all platform revenue. Our investment of $63-96K in discounts should participate in uncapped upside if the platform succeeds.

**Optional consideration:** If you're open to it, we'd welcome a nominal 2% continuation after Year 4. This would signal true long-term partnership alignment, though we understand if you prefer a clean 48-month term. Either way, the core proposal above stands on its own.

### Exit Participation

If XTND is acquired at any point, we'd like to participate at 0.5% of the transaction value. This rewards our early commitment to building the platform and aligns our incentives with your long-term success.

### Intellectual Property

We'd like to carve out our pre-existing tools and generic development patterns (CI/CD templates, DevOps scripts, architectural patterns). We commit not to rebuild your platform or serve direct competitors. You'd have perpetual license to use anything we embed in the platform.

We're not looking to rewrite the agreement - these are targeted adjustments to make the partnership sustainable for both sides.

This is our first partnership engagement in 10 years of working together. I believe this could be a great opportunity to go beyond the consulting services we've provided over the past decade - building something together where we both have skin in the game.

Happy to discuss on a call this week.

Best regards,
Hoang

## Notes for Internal Use

**Tone:** Collaborative, not adversarial
**Goal:** Get answers to questions + agreement on key terms
**Fallback positions:**
- If they reject uncapped: propose $350K cap
- If they reject 48 months: accept 36 months if they agree to remove cap
- If they reject March 1 start: accept April 1 as final compromise
- If they reject 0.5% exit: propose 0.25% or capped at $250K
- **2% ongoing is fully optional** - drop immediately if any resistance (already framed as optional in email)


## Their response

Hi Hoang,



Thank you again for your feedback and for the time you’ve put into reviewing this with us. We really appreciate the care you’re taking here. We’ve now completed a full legal review with our attorney and finalized the Platform Development agreement, and I wanted to respond to your remaining questions and clarify how they’re reflected in the final version.



Revenue Share Timing

We’ve kept the revenue share start aligned with GA (reflected as revenue collected on or after June 1, 2026). Any revenue prior to GA is expected to be limited and will be used to fund the resources needed to get us to GA across both the Vietnam and U.S. teams. The GA product is what enables us to reliably close and scale platform revenue, which is why revenue sharing begins at that point.



Platform vs. Implementation Revenue

Implementation fees are one-time, non-recurring fees collected to cover U.S.-based resources required to onboard and deploy the product. There is little to no margin in these fees, and they’re essential to making the GA platform usable for customers. As reflected in the agreement, revenue share is intentionally tied only to recurring platform revenue, while implementation services (by either team) are billed separately at standard commercial rates and excluded from revenue share. Longer-term upside beyond revenue share is addressed through the 0.5% equity component.



Rate Structure Beyond Month 6

We aren’t able to pre-define stepped rate increases through Months 7–12 and beyond. From an investor and fundability standpoint, we need flexibility after Month 6 to account for scope, staffing levels, and platform maturity. To keep this fair, the agreement includes a mechanical revenue share cap adjustment tied to the actual discount provided, rather than fixed future rates that may not reflect real conditions.



Revenue Share Term and Cap

After legal review, we can’t extend revenue share beyond 36 months or remove the cap, as both would introduce material financing and diligence risk. We’ve increased the cap to $225,000 and added a formula-based cap increase if discounted rates extend beyond Month 6, which directly reflects incremental contribution while keeping the structure bounded and fundable.



Exit Participation

We’re not able to include exit-based participation tied directly to transaction value. Our attorney advised that this would create diligence and structural issues for future investors and acquirers. Instead, long-term alignment is provided through the 0.5% non-voting equity, tied to GA + first paying customer, with 48-month vesting, standard dilution, and issuance deferred to a priced round or agreed milestone.



Intellectual Property

We’re aligned conceptually on IP carve-outs and the treatment of pre-existing tools. Those provisions belong in the Independent Contractor Agreement, which governs IP across engagements rather than the Platform Development Economic Schedule. Our attorney has reviewed this in that context and will be providing the final contract next week. That is the only change needed for the ICA.



Overall, we believe the final Platform Development agreement fairly reflects the investment you’re making, recognizes our long-standing partnership, and keeps XTND well positioned for financing and growth. If this looks good on your side, we’re ready to move forward with execution so the full team can begin the build.



Happy to walk through anything on a call if helpful.


## Our Final Response (Ready to Sign)

**To:** [XTND Contact]
**Subject:** RE: Partnership Agreement - Ready to Proceed

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the detailed response and for working through these points with us. We appreciate the adjustments made to the agreement, particularly the increased cap and the extended discount adjustment formula.

We're ready to move forward and sign the Platform Development Economic Schedule.

Before we execute, I'd like to confirm a few operational points for clarity (not contract changes — just alignment):

**1. Multi-Project Operations**
Can you confirm that ~70% dedication to XTND during the build phase is acceptable? As discussed, we operate as a multi-project firm, and other client work is billed separately at standard rates without affecting your timelines or pricing.

**2. Equity Issuance Timeline**
The agreement ties equity issuance to a priced equity round or mutual milestone. Do you have a rough timeline for when you expect a priced round? This helps us understand the equity component better. If there's no near-term plan, we're still comfortable proceeding — just want to set expectations.

**3. Extension Rate Discussions**
If the build extends past Month 6, the agreement mentions a "good faith" rate review. As a starting point for that future discussion, would $20/hr for months 7-12 be a reasonable anchor? Not asking to lock this in — just want to ensure we're aligned on the spirit of "good faith."

Once you confirm these points, we'll sign and return the agreement. Looking forward to kicking off the build.

Best regards,
Hoang

**Internal Notes:**

- If they push back on any of these, still sign. These are "nice to have" confirmations, not deal-breakers.
- Goal: Get written acknowledgment (even informal) on multi-project and rate anchor.
- Equity question is informational — their answer tells us how seriously to value it.
- Tone: Collaborative, ready to execute, no more negotiation.
