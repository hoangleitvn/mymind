# Email Draft: XTND Partnership Discussion

**To:** [XTND Contact]
**Subject:** Partnership Agreement - A Few Questions Before We Finalize

Hi [Name],

Thank you for sharing the partnership agreements. We've reviewed both documents and are excited about moving forward together.

Before we sign, we'd like to discuss a few points to ensure we're set up for a successful long-term partnership - not just a 6-month project.

## Questions

**1. Revenue Share Timing**
The current terms have revenue share starting June 1, 2026. Since we're starting work January 1 at discounted rates, we'd like to understand: do you expect to collect platform revenue during Jan-May? Would you consider starting revenue share from March 1, 2026? This gives you 2 months before we participate, while still aligning closer to when we begin work.

**2. Revenue Structure - Platform vs. Implementation**
The contract excludes implementation fees from revenue share. Can you help us understand:
- How do you typically structure customer contracts (platform fees vs. implementation fees)?
- What percentage of a typical customer deal is platform revenue vs. implementation?
- Who decides what counts as "implementation" vs. "platform" when onboarding a new client?
- For example, if a customer pays $100K/year, what's the typical breakdown?

**3. Revenue Projections**
Can you share projected platform revenue for the next 12 months? This helps us evaluate the partnership economics.

**4. Multi-Project Operations**
We operate as a multi-project firm serving several clients (this is how we keep rates competitive). A few clarifications:
- Is 70% dedication to XTND during build phase acceptable? We'd maintain 50% during hypercare.
- If XTND has delays or reduced scope temporarily, can we reallocate team members to other projects?
- How do you define "primarily dedicated" in practical terms?

**5. Other Client Work**
For transparency: we have ongoing commitments to other clients. Work for other clients is billed separately at our standard rates and doesn't affect your pricing or timelines. Is this arrangement acceptable?

## Suggestions

We'd like to propose a few adjustments that we believe benefit both parties:

### Rate Structure for Extensions

Your contract mentions "good faith review" if build extends past Month 4. To avoid ambiguity later, we propose defining this upfront:

- **Months 1-6:** $16.75/hr (as agreed)
- **Months 7-12:** $20.00/hr (if extended)
- **Month 13+:** $23.50/hr (ICA standard)

This gives you continued discounted rates while providing us clarity.

### Revenue Share Terms

We're taking meaningful investment risk with the discounted rate:

- **Build phase (M1-6):** 9,360 hours at $16.75 vs. $23.50 standard = **$63K discount**
- **Extended phase (M7-12):** 9,360 hours at $20.00 vs. $23.50 standard = **$33K discount**
- **Total investment (if 12 months):** **$96K** in rate discounts

This is real investment we're making in your platform's success. In exchange, we'd like to propose:

- **Start date:** March 1, 2026 (gives you 2 months before we participate)
- **Term:** 48 months at 6% (instead of 36 months capped)
- **Cap:** Remove the $170K cap

At 6% for 4 years, you keep 94% of all platform revenue. Our investment of $63-96K in discounts should participate in uncapped upside if the platform succeeds.

**Optional consideration:** If you're open to it, we'd welcome a nominal 2% continuation after Year 4. This would signal true long-term partnership alignment, though we understand if you prefer a clean 48-month term. Either way, the core proposal above stands on its own.

### Exit Participation

If XTND is acquired at any point, we'd like to participate at 0.5% of the transaction value. This rewards our early commitment to building the platform and aligns our incentives with your long-term success.

### Intellectual Property

We'd like to carve out our pre-existing tools and generic development patterns (CI/CD templates, DevOps scripts, architectural patterns). We commit not to rebuild your platform or serve direct competitors. You'd have perpetual license to use anything we embed in the platform.

We're not looking to rewrite the agreement - these are targeted adjustments to make the partnership sustainable for both sides.

This is our first partnership engagement in 10 years of working together. I believe this could be a great opportunity to go beyond the consulting services we've provided over the past decade - building something together where we both have skin in the game.

Happy to discuss on a call this week.

Best regards,
Hoang

## Notes for Internal Use

**Tone:** Collaborative, not adversarial
**Goal:** Get answers to questions + agreement on key terms
**Fallback positions:**
- If they reject uncapped: propose $350K cap
- If they reject 48 months: accept 36 months if they agree to remove cap
- If they reject March 1 start: accept April 1 as final compromise
- If they reject 0.5% exit: propose 0.25% or capped at $250K
- **2% ongoing is fully optional** - drop immediately if any resistance (already framed as optional in email)
