## Comparison: Current Contract vs. Proposed

### Current Contract Terms
- 6% for 36 months
- Capped at $170K
- No exit participation
- Ends after 36 months

### Proposed Terms
- 6% for 48 months, then 2% ongoing
- No cap
- 0.5% exit participation
- True long-term partnership

| Scenario | Current Terms | Proposed Terms | Difference |
|----------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Conservative | $144K (capped) | $166K | **+$22K** |
| Moderate | $170K (capped) | $350K | **+$180K** |
| Optimistic | $170K (capped) | $928K | **+$758K** |
| Moderate + exit | $170K (capped, no exit) | $390K | **+$220K** |
| Strong + big exit | $170K (capped, no exit) | $1.43M | **+$1.26M** |

## Break-Even Analysis

| Investment | Revenue Needed to Break Even |
|------------|------------------------------|
| $63K (6 months) | $1.05M over 48 months |
| $96K (12 months) | $1.6M over 48 months |

**Conservative scenario ($3.5M) easily covers break-even.**

---

## Key Insights

1. **Minimum ROI:** Even in conservative scenario, ROI is 163%
2. **Upside matters:** Difference between capped vs uncapped is $22K - $1.26M
3. **2% ongoing adds significant value:** $22K-$160K/year after Year 4
4. **Exit is significant:** 0.5% exit participation can match or exceed revenue share
5. **Extended build still profitable:** Even at 12 months, ROI is 227%
6. **Risk is limited:** Investment is $63-96K; worst case is slow growth with 163% ROI
7. **True partnership:** 2% perpetual creates long-term alignment

## Recommendation

The proposed terms (48 months at 6%, then 2% ongoing, uncapped + 0.5% exit) are justified by:
- $63-96K investment from discounted rates
- Minimum 163% ROI in conservative scenario
- Potential 20x+ return in success scenarios
- Exit participation captures value if platform is sold
- 2% ongoing demonstrates true long-term partnership commitment
