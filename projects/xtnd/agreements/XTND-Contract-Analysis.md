# XTND Partnership Contract Analysis

## Executive Summary

Innomize is entering a hybrid partnership with XTND Technologies involving:
- **Reduced hourly rate:** $16.75/hr blended (vs. ICA standard $23.50/hr)
- **Revenue share:** 6% of gross platform revenue, capped at $170K over 36 months
- **Team commitment:** 12 resources for 6-month initial phase

**Key finding:** The current structure favors a short-term project, not a long-term partnership. Several provisions create financial risk and operational ambiguity that should be addressed before signing.

**Estimated discount given:** ~$63K (6 months) to ~$94K (12 months)
**Current maximum upside:** $170K cap (requires ~$2.83M platform revenue)
**Proposed maximum upside:** Uncapped revenue share + exit participation

## Detailed Analysis

### Concern 1: Below-Market Rate with Speculative Upside

**Current state:**
- Blended rate: $16.75/hr for all 12 resources
- ICA standard rate: $23.50/hr
- Discount per hour: $6.75/hr

**Financial impact:**

| Phase | Hours | Discount Given |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Phase 1 (4 months) | 7,200 hrs | $48,600 |
| Phase 2 (2 months) | 2,160 hrs | $14,580 |
| **Total 6 months** | **9,360 hrs** | **$63,180** |

**Risk:** Revenue share is speculative. XTND has no obligation to generate revenue (Section 7 of Economic Schedule).

**Proposed approach:**
1. Accept reduced rate for initial build phase
2. Negotiate automatic rate step-up for extensions
3. Add milestone bonuses tied to platform success
4. Request revenue projections to validate upside potential

### Concern 2: Revenue Share Cap Doesn't Scale

**Current state:**
- Cap: $170,000 regardless of engagement duration
- Term: 36 months or cap reached, whichever first

**Problem:** Extended engagement increases discount given but cap stays fixed.

| Duration | Discount Given | Max Revenue Share | Net Potential |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 6 months | $63K | $170K | +$107K |
| 9 months | $95K | $170K | +$75K |
| 12 months | $126K | $170K | +$44K |
| 15 months | $158K | $170K | +$12K |
| 18 months | $189K | $170K | **-$19K** |

**Proposed approach:**

Option A - Sliding cap:
> "Revenue Share cap increases by $30,000 for each additional month of Platform development beyond Month 6 at the reduced blended rate, up to maximum aggregate cap of $350,000."

Option B - Automatic rate step-up:
> "If Platform development extends beyond Month 6, blended rate adjusts to $19.50/hr for Months 7-9, and $21.50/hr for Month 10+, returning to ICA standard rate of $23.50/hr after Month 12."

### Concern 3: Implementation Fees Excluded

**Current state (Economic Schedule lines 179-188):**
> "Gross Revenue shall exclude all one-time or non-recurring implementation fees, onboarding fees, configuration fees, migration fees, training fees... regardless of whether such services are performed by XTND personnel or Partner personnel."

**Risk:** XTND can structure customer deals to maximize implementation fees (excluded) and minimize platform fees (included in revenue share).

**Example:**
- Customer pays $100K/year
- Structure A: $90K platform + $10K implementation → Your share: $5,400
- Structure B: $50K platform + $50K implementation → Your share: $3,000

**Proposed approach:**

Option A - Cap exclusion percentage:
> "Implementation Fees excluded from Gross Revenue shall not exceed 25% of total customer contract value. Amounts exceeding 25% shall be included in Gross Revenue."

Option B - Include at reduced rate:
> "Implementation Fees shall be subject to Revenue Share at 3% (rather than 6%)."

Option C - Require transparency:
> "XTND shall provide quarterly reporting showing allocation between Platform Revenue and Implementation Fees for each customer contract."

### Concern 4: No Revenue Visibility

**Current state:** No revenue projections provided. Revenue share requires ~$2.83M gross revenue to reach $170K cap.

**Questions to resolve:**
- What is XTND's current ARR/MRR?
- What is projected revenue for next 6-12 months?
- What is typical customer contract value?
- What is the platform vs. implementation fee split historically?

**Proposed approach:**
- Request financial projections or business plan excerpt
- Request sample customer contract structure
- Add quarterly revenue reporting requirement to agreement

### Concern 5: Multi-Project Resource Allocation

**Current state (Economic Schedule):**
> "Resources assigned under this Agreement are expected to be primarily dedicated to XTND Platform development during active phases."
> "XTND acknowledges that limited shared utilization may occur, provided such sharing does not materially impact delivery commitments."

**Problem:** "Primarily dedicated" and "limited shared utilization" are undefined. Innomize operates multiple projects (LD, GymCube, iFourLife, etc.).

**Risks:**
- XTND claims breach for "insufficient dedication"
- Innomize underutilizes resources during XTND slow periods
- Unclear how to bill other clients during shared time

**Proposed approach:**

Define allocation quantitatively:
> "During Phase 1 (Months 1-4), assigned resources shall allocate minimum 70% of monthly billable capacity to XTND. During Phase 2 (Months 5-6), minimum allocation shall be 50%."

Add delay protection:
> "If XTND-driven delays result in resources unable to perform Platform work for more than five (5) business days, Partner may reallocate such resources without penalty."

Clarify billing separation:
> "Work performed for other clients is billed separately at Partner's standard rates and is not subject to XTND approval or disclosure."

### Concern 6: IP Assignment with No Reuse Rights

**Current state (ICA Section 6.6):**
> "Independent Contractor retains no ownership, license, residual, or reuse rights in Platform IP or Developed Works and may not reuse Platform IP for any other client, employer, or internal project."

**Problem:** Blocks reuse of:
- Generic architecture patterns
- DevOps pipelines and CI/CD templates
- Integration approaches
- Pre-existing Innomize tools and utilities

**Proposed approach:**

Add retained methodology rights:
> **6.7 Retained Methodology Rights**
>
> Partner retains the right to use and reuse:
> (a) General skills, knowledge, and experience gained during Services;
> (b) Generic architectural patterns and methodologies not specific to Platform's unique business logic;
> (c) Partner's pre-existing tools, scripts, libraries, and frameworks ("Partner Tools"), provided Partner grants Corporation perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use Partner Tools as embedded in Platform IP;
> (d) Generic DevOps configurations, CI/CD templates, and infrastructure patterns.
>
> Partner shall not: (i) rebuild or replicate substantially similar platform for any third party; (ii) license Platform-specific code or business logic; (iii) provide services to direct competitors using Platform-derived materials.

### Concern 7: Asymmetric Liability

**Current state (ICA Section 21):**
- XTND liability: Capped at 12-month fees paid
- Innomize liability: **Uncapped** for IP, confidentiality, data protection, indemnification

**Risk:** A single security incident or IP dispute could exceed total contract value.

**Proposed approach:**
> "Independent Contractor's aggregate liability for claims arising under Sections 6, 9, 11, and 12 shall not exceed two (2) times the total amounts paid to Independent Contractor in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct."

### Concern 8: One-Way Indemnification

**Current state (ICA Section 12):**
- Innomize indemnifies XTND for: breach, IP infringement, security failures, law violations
- XTND indemnifies Innomize for: **Nothing**

**Proposed approach:**
> "Corporation shall indemnify Partner for claims arising from: (i) materials, specifications, or third-party IP provided by Corporation; (ii) Corporation's breach of this Agreement; (iii) Corporation's violation of applicable law."

### Concern 9: No Revenue Share Audit Rights

**Current state (ICA Section 10):**
> "Independent Contractor shall have no audit rights with respect to Corporation's systems, data, customers, or Platform, except solely as necessary to verify invoicing or payment disputes."

**Problem:** Innomize cannot verify revenue share calculations. Must trust XTND's monthly statements.

**Proposed approach:**
> "Partner shall have the right, upon reasonable notice and no more than once per calendar year, to engage an independent auditor to verify Gross Revenue calculations. If discrepancy exceeds 5%, Corporation shall bear audit costs and promptly remit any underpayment."

### Concern 10: Short-Term Structure vs. Long-Term Intent

**Current state:**
- Initial term: 6 months (4 build + 2 hypercare)
- Revenue share: 36 months or $170K cap
- Post-Phase 2: Undefined, "may mutually agree" to new terms

**Problem:** No built-in path for ongoing partnership. After Phase 2, must renegotiate from scratch.

**Proposed approach - Long-Term Partnership Structure:**

**Key insight:** The mature phase rate ($23.50/hr) is not the issue. If XTND succeeds, they will naturally continue using Innomize at standard rates. The real question is how to structure partnership alignment from day one.

### Current Deal Structure (Short-Term Focused)

| Element | Current Terms | Problem |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Reduced rate | $16.75/hr for 6 months | One-time discount, no ongoing benefit |
| Revenue share | 6% for 36 months, capped $170K | Fixed cap regardless of contribution |
| After Phase 2 | "May mutually agree" to new terms | No built-in partnership path |

### Proposed: Long-Term Partnership Alignment

**Principle:** Tie revenue share benefits to continued partnership, not just the initial 6-month build.

**Recommended Proposal: 3-Tier Rate + Uncapped Revenue Share**

### Problem with Current Contract

The Schedule Adjustments section states:
> "If the core build phase extends beyond Month 4 by more than forty-five (45) days... the parties agree to review the blended rate and/or Revenue Share cap **in good faith**"

**Issue:** "Good faith" is undefined. Leaves Innomize in weak negotiating position later.

**Solution:** Define rate tiers and remove cap upfront.

### Proposed Rate Structure

| Phase | Duration | Rate | Discount from ICA |
|-------|----------|------|-------------------|
| **Build** | Months 1-6 | $16.75/hr | 29% discount |
| **Extended Build** | Months 7-12 | $20.00/hr | 15% discount |
| **Ongoing** | Month 13+ | $23.50/hr | ICA standard |

### Proposed Revenue Share

| Element | Current Contract | Proposed |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Percentage | 6% | 6% |
| Term | 36 months | **48 months** |
| Cap | $170,000 | **No cap** |
| Payment | Monthly, within 30 days | Monthly, within 30 days |
| Audit rights | None | **Annual verification right** |

### Proposed Exit Participation (New)

| Element | Current Contract | Proposed |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Exit participation | None | **0.5% of acquisition value** |
| Cap | N/A | **No cap** (or $500K if XTND pushes back) |
| Time limit | N/A | **No time limit** (anytime exit) |

**Exit participation examples:**

| XTND Acquisition Price | Your 0.5% Share |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| $10M | $50K |
| $30M | $150K |
| $50M | $250K |
| $100M | $500K |

### Why This Works for Both Parties

**For Innomize:**
- Clear rate ladder defined upfront (no "good faith" ambiguity)
- Uncapped revenue share rewards risk-taking
- 48-month term captures more platform growth
- Exit participation captures upside from acquisition anytime
- Annual audit right ensures transparency
- Discount is finite and predictable (max 12 months)

**For XTND:**
- Still gets discounted rates during build (months 1-12)
- Revenue share term is fixed at 48 months (natural limit)
- 6% is modest - XTND keeps 94% of all revenue
- Rate returns to standard after month 12
- Exit participation only triggers on actual liquidity event

### Financial Summary by Build Duration

| Build Duration | Discount Given | Revenue Share (48 months, uncapped) |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 6 months | $63K | 6% of all platform revenue |
| 9 months | $79K | 6% of all platform revenue |
| 12 months | $94K | 6% of all platform revenue |
| 18 months | $94K (no more discount after M12) | 6% of all platform revenue |

### Upside Scenarios (48 months, uncapped)

| Platform Revenue (4 years) | Revenue Share | Exit ($50M) | Total Potential |
|----------------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| $2M | $120K | $250K | $370K |
| $5M | $300K | $250K | $550K |
| $10M | $600K | $250K | $850K |
| $20M | $1.2M | $250K | $1.45M |

### Proposed Contract Language

**Rate Schedule (replace "Schedule Adjustments" section):**

> "Partner shall provide Platform development services at the following rates:
> - Months 1-6: $16.75/hr (Platform Build Phase)
> - Months 7-12: $20.00/hr (Extended Build Phase, if applicable)
> - Month 13+: $23.50/hr (ICA Standard Rate)
>
> Rate transitions occur automatically based on calendar months from Effective Date, regardless of scope changes or delays."

**Revenue Participation (replace Section 5):**

> "Revenue Participation:
> - Rate: 6% of Gross Platform Revenue
> - Term: 48 months from first revenue recognition (June 1, 2026)
> - Cap: None
>
> Revenue Share payments shall be calculated monthly and remitted within thirty (30) days following each calendar month, accompanied by a summary statement of Gross Revenue and applicable exclusions."

**Revenue Share Audit Rights (add new section):**

> "Partner shall have the right, upon reasonable notice and no more than once per calendar year, to engage an independent auditor to verify Gross Revenue calculations and Revenue Share payments. If any audit reveals a discrepancy exceeding 5% of amounts owed, Corporation shall bear all audit costs and promptly remit any underpayment with interest at 1.5% per month. Audit rights shall survive for 24 months following termination of Revenue Share obligations."

**Exit Participation (add new section):**

> "In the event of an Acquisition, merger, IPO, or sale of substantially all Platform assets ('Exit Event') at any time, Partner shall receive a one-time payment equal to 0.5% of the total transaction value attributable to the Platform, payable within thirty (30) days of closing. This Exit Participation is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any Revenue Share amounts earned prior to the Exit Event."

**Option B: Partnership Milestone Bonuses**

In addition to revenue share, add success bonuses tied to platform growth:

| Milestone | Bonus | Condition |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Platform GA launch | $10,000 | Partner actively engaged at launch |
| First $500K ARR | $20,000 | Partner provided 12+ months service |
| First $1M ARR | $30,000 | Partner provided 18+ months service |
| First $2M ARR | $50,000 | Partner provided 24+ months service |
| Exit event (acquisition/IPO) | 0.5% of transaction (cap $200K) | Partner provided 12+ months service |

**Why this works:**
- Creates shared success moments
- Bonuses require continued partnership to qualify
- Exit participation rewards early bet on platform

**Option C: Preferred Partner Status**

> "Following successful completion of Phase 1-2, Partner shall be designated as Preferred Development Partner for the Platform. As Preferred Partner:
> (a) Partner shall have first right of refusal for new Platform development work;
> (b) XTND shall provide minimum 60 days notice before engaging alternative development resources;
> (c) Partner's standard rate for ongoing work shall be $23.50/hr (ICA rate) with no further discount required."

**Why this works:**
- Formalizes long-term relationship
- Protects against being replaced after building platform
- Establishes Innomize as strategic partner, not just vendor

### Concern 11: Phantom Stock Alternative

**Current state:** XTND rejected phantom stock. Revenue share is the alternative but has limitations:
- Capped at $170K regardless of platform success
- No participation in equity events (funding, acquisition, IPO)
- Terminates at 36 months

**Proposed approach - Success fee on exit:**
> "In event of Acquisition, IPO, or majority asset sale within 5 years of Effective Date, Partner shall receive one-time success fee equal to 0.5% of transaction value attributable to Platform, capped at $250,000, payable at closing."

**Alternative - Milestone bonuses:**

| Milestone | Bonus |
|-----------|-------|
| Platform GA launch | $15,000 |
| First $500K ARR | $25,000 |
| First $1M ARR | $35,000 |
| First $2M ARR | $50,000 |

### Concern 12: Phase Extension Economics

**Current state (Economic Schedule):**
> "If core build phase extends beyond Month 4 by more than forty-five (45) days due to XTND-driven scope changes, parties agree to review blended rate and/or Revenue Share cap in good faith."

**Problem:** "Good faith review" is non-binding. No automatic adjustment.

**Proposed approach:**
> "If Phase 1 extends beyond Month 4 by more than 45 days due to XTND-driven scope changes, blended rate shall automatically adjust to $19.50/hr for work beyond Month 5, unless otherwise agreed in writing."

## Questions for XTND (Simplified)

### Must Ask

1. **Revenue timing:** What revenue do you expect to collect Jan-May 2026? Can revenue share start from January 1 instead of June 1?

2. **Revenue structure:** What's the typical split between platform fees vs. implementation fees per customer?

3. **Extended build:** If build extends past 6 months, can we agree on $20/hr for months 7-12 now (instead of "good faith review")?

4. **Revenue share term:** Would you consider 48 months instead of 36 months, given we're taking early risk?

5. **Revenue share cap:** Would you consider removing the $170K cap? You still keep 94% of all revenue.

6. **Exit participation:** If XTND is acquired, can we participate at 0.5% of the transaction?

7. **IP reuse:** Can we carve out pre-existing tools and generic patterns for use with other clients (not competitors)?

8. **Multi-project:** Is 70% dedication to XTND acceptable during build phase? We serve other clients too.

### Nice to Ask

9. **Audit rights:** Can we verify revenue share calculations once per year?

10. **Liability cap:** Can we cap our liability at 2x annual fees?

11. **Revenue projections:** What's projected platform revenue for next 12 months?

## Our Proposal (Simple Version)

## Negotiation Priority Matrix

| Priority | Item | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Must Have** | Pre-existing IP carve-out | Protects core business |
| **Must Have** | Revenue share audit rights | Cannot verify calculations otherwise |
| **Must Have** | Liability cap for Innomize | Unlimited liability is existential risk |
| **Must Have** | Multi-project allocation clarity | Enables sustainable operations |
| **Should Have** | Sliding revenue cap for extensions | Prevents negative economics on extended engagement |
| **Should Have** | Success fee on exit | Captures upside if platform sold |
| **Should Have** | Phase extension rate adjustment | Fair risk-sharing on scope changes |
| **Should Have** | Implementation fee transparency | Prevents revenue gaming |
| **Nice to Have** | Reciprocal indemnification | Standard but may not get |
| **Nice to Have** | Milestone bonuses | Alternative upside mechanism |
| **Nice to Have** | Neutral arbitration venue | Convenience, not critical |

## Recommended Talking Points

### Opening Frame

> "We're excited about this partnership. Before signing, we want to address a few items that will help us commit fully and sustain this over the long term—not just 6 months."

### On Multi-Project Operations

> "We run a multi-project operation—that's how we keep rates competitive. We want to be transparent: your team will be 70% dedicated during build, 50% during hypercare. Other client work is billed separately and doesn't affect your pricing."

### On IP Reuse

> "We're fully committed to your platform ownership. We just need to carve out general patterns and our pre-existing tools—things we've built over years that we use across all clients. We'll commit in writing not to rebuild your platform or serve competitors."

### On Revenue Share

> "We're betting on your success with this rate discount. Annual verification keeps both sides honest. And if there's an exit, we'd like to share in the upside we helped create."

### On Extended Duration

> "If the build extends past 6 months, the economics get tight for us. At 18 months, we'd be giving $189K in discounts against a $170K cap—that's a guaranteed loss. Can we agree that rates step up toward the $23.50 ICA rate, or the cap increases proportionally?"

## Next Steps

1. Review this analysis internally
2. Prioritize which items to negotiate vs. accept
3. Prepare opening email/call to XTND
4. Request financial information (revenue projections, customer structure)
5. Draft proposed contract amendments for priority items
6. Schedule negotiation call with XTND

### Break-Even Analysis (with Proposed Terms)

| Duration | Discount Given | Platform Revenue to Break Even |
|----------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 6 months | $63K | $1.05M over 48 months |
| 9 months | $79K | $1.32M over 48 months |
| 12 months | $94K | $1.57M over 48 months |

**Note:** With uncapped revenue share and 48-month term, break-even is much more achievable. Any exit event adds significant upside.
