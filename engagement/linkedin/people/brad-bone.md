## About

AI professional with 950 followers. Posts "unpopular opinions" and thought-provoking takes about AI capabilities and limitations. First interaction was on his post arguing AI cannot build authentic trust due to lacking intent, empathy, and accountability.

## Why Engage

- Posts on AI philosophy topics that align with my systems-thinking approach
- Engages thoughtfully with pushback (thread shows quality discussion)
- Smaller audience but potentially valuable for genuine connection

## Engagement Notes

- First engagement on 2026-01-17 via AI trust post
- Offered constructive pushback: trust is about predictability, not empathy
- Used weather app example to make point concrete
- Referenced Dr. Otani's comment to show I read the thread

## Relationship Goals

- Build visibility in AI philosophy discussions
- Demonstrate systems-thinking perspective
- Potential for ongoing debate/discussion

## Potential Value Exchange

- We can offer: Systems-thinking perspective, practitioner grounding, concrete examples
- They might offer: Thought-provoking prompts, philosophy discussions, smaller but engaged audience
