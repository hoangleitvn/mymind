## Profile

**Role:** Tech Leader
**Focus:** AI-assisted development, production systems, workflow automation

## Why Track

- Builds production apps with AI coding agents
- Strong "review every line" approach to AI-generated code
- Sets up architecture before involving AI (auth, observability, CI/CD)
- Aligns with our themes: foundation-first, AI tooling, practical engineering

## Interaction History

| Date | Type | Topic | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| 2026-01-06 | Comment | AI workflow app review process | Asked about decision triggers for reviewing AI code |

## Notes

- Built workflow app in 2 days with AI, deployed to GCP by day 3
- Tech stack: FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, GCP CloudRun
- Key insight: "wrote almost no code but reviewed almost every line"
- Concerned about newer devs skipping production-readiness fundamentals
