| 2025-12-25 | comment | Vibe coding for PMs | [engagement](../comments/2025-12-25-anton-shatokhin-vibe-coding-pms.md) |

## Notes

- Strong take: "Vibe coding for PMs is becoming non-negotiable. Like Excel in 2010. Like Figma in 2020."
- Aligns with our WHAT vs HOW framework
- Potential for deeper engagement on AI-assisted development topics
