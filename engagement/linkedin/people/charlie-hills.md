## About

LinkedIn coach and content creator with ~189k followers. Posts about LinkedIn growth systems, content creation frameworks, and personal branding.

Content style is promotional (sells AI Creators Club, courses) but includes actionable advice mixed in.

## Why Engage

- Large audience in the LinkedIn creator space
- Some genuine advice worth engaging with
- Not core to my technical themes, but relevant for content creation

## Engagement Notes

- First engagement: Picked the "don't post and ghost" insight, ignored promotional pitch
- His content is very formulaic but reaches large audience
- Low priority for relationship building, occasional engagement on useful posts

## Relationship Goals

- Light engagement when content is genuinely useful
- Not seeking deeper relationship (different focus areas)

## Potential Value Exchange

- His audience might find my technical content perspective interesting
- Not much direct value exchange given different themes
