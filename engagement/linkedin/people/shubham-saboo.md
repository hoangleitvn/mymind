## About

AI agent builder sharing frameworks for context engineering and agent architecture.

Posts about the practical challenges of building AI agents, particularly around balancing instruction density with agent autonomy.

## Why Engage

- Directly relevant to our agentic AI architecture expertise
- Similar problem space (building production AI agents)
- Opportunity to share progressive context injection patterns

## Engagement Notes

- First engagement: Added depth on runtime optimization for his hierarchical context framework
- His "doubled velocity" claim suggests practical builder, not theorist
- Quality technical content worth following

## Relationship Goals

- Build recognition as fellow AI agent builder
- Share complementary architectural patterns
- Potential knowledge exchange on agent design patterns

## Potential Value Exchange

- We can offer: Progressive context injection patterns, caching strategies, conflict resolution approaches
- They might offer: Community insights, agent architecture frameworks, builder network
