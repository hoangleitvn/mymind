## About

AI practitioner based in Spain. Posts about moving beyond prompts to system-level AI reliability.

His "density" metaphor for AI maturity (prompts → workflows → agents → multi-agent) shows systems thinking.

## Why Engage

- Strong philosophical alignment with our "workflow first, tools last" framework
- His conclusion "Reliability is an engineering problem, not a prompting problem" echoes our message
- Thoughtful content about AI engineering, not just hype

## Engagement Notes

- First engagement: 2026-01-14 on AI reliability post
- Shared our framework and CLAUDE.md approach
- He replied positively (2026-01-15): "Teams stuck optimizing prompts are still in experimentation mode. Teams building workflows, rules, and feedback loops are the ones shipping reliable systems."
- Good alignment signal, worth building relationship

## Relationship Goals

- Build visibility with AI engineering audience
- Potential thought partner on AI workflow topics

## Potential Value Exchange

- We can offer: Concrete framework (workflow first), real examples (CLAUDE.md rules, 12 patterns)
- They might offer: Different perspective on AI maturity, audience reach in Spanish market
