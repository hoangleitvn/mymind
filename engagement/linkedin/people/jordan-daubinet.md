# Jordan Daubinet

## Context

Commented on post about AI bubble vs snowball, defending weather forecasting AI at Jua.ai as an example of AI that works well (not a "snowball" problem).

## Company: Jua.ai

Weather forecasting company using ML models. Jordan describes their models as "industry leading in weather forecasting."

## Engagement Notes

- Mild disagreement with post's framing
- Valid point: domain-specific ML with clear metrics is different from vibe coding
- Professional tone, not confrontational
- Company promotion embedded in comment (acceptable context)
