## About

Founder of Fluently (AI English tutor). High-follower account (119K). Posts primarily about startup growth, marketing, and UGC strategy.

## Why Not Engage

- Content focuses on marketing/growth, not engineering or AI adoption
- Outside our professional positioning
- No natural angle to add value from our expertise

## Reference Value

- Good systematic approach to content growth
- "Track revenue, not likes" - outcome-focused
- "Repeat what works" - systems thinking
- Worth following for content strategy insights, not professional engagement
