## About

Academic/practitioner focused on AI governance and enterprise AI architecture. Emphasizes understanding architectural layers (system prompts, memory, RAG) rather than treating AI as "learning" systems.

## Why Engage

- Deep technical governance perspective
- Architecture-first thinking aligns with our approach
- Enterprise AI focus relevant to our audience

## Engagement Notes

- Clarifies misconception: models don't learn from conversations
- Three layers: system prompts, external memory, RAG/state
- Key question: "Could you point to the exact layer where change was authorised?"

## Potential Value Exchange

- Share practical experience with AI governance challenges
- Add implementation perspective to academic framing
- Build connection in AI governance space
