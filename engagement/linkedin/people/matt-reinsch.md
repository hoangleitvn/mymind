## About

Engaged on serverless vs containers post with substantive technical insight. Understands workload categorization (event-driven, long-running, stateful).

## Why Engage

- Shows technical depth in cloud architecture
- Added value to our post with "cold starts as forcing function" framing
- Potential for ongoing technical discussions

## Engagement Notes

- First interaction via comment on our post
- His insight about workload fit vs cost argument is worth referencing
- Good back-and-forth conversation developing
- Shared pattern: teams equating "triggered by event" with "event-driven architecture"
- His framing: "event-driven at edges, persistent where continuity matters"

## Relationship Goals

- Build connection in cloud architecture space
- Learn from his perspective on workload patterns

## Potential Value Exchange

- I can share serverless patterns and cost analysis
- He might share real-world workload categorization examples
