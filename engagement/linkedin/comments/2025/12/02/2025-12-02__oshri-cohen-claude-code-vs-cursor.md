## Original Post

I've tried Claude Code
Then I've tried Cursor…
Now I'm back with Claude Code, while its tooling is nowhere near what Cursor offers, I like its reasoning approach to coding tasks so much better…
Or maybe it's a first love thing… who knows…
In any event, I get higher-quality code far faster

No other tool I tried so far is nowhere close to the quality and speed Claude code gives me. Since it supports skills, things got a lot better and also cheaper in terms of tokens used.

If you're a CLI fan CC is so good. Cursor's ability to take screenshots of the browser is pretty awesome though. A tool for each job I suppose.

    Same experience. Cursor has better tooling, but Claude Code's reasoning depth wins for complex tasks.

    The skills feature changed the game for me. Reduced token usage and got more consistent results by giving it structured context upfront.
  strategy: "Personal Experience - Validates his experience, adds practical insight about skills feature that reinforces Tobias's comment."
```

## Notes

- Directly relevant to our Claude Code content
- Good engagement post with active discussion
- Skills feature angle adds value beyond generic agreement
