## Original Post

AI will replace you 😥😓
But only if you ignore it.

Everyone keeps saying AI will take jobs.
So why not learn the tools and put AI to work for you?

As a developer, I write code, test it, debug it and repeat the same tasks every day.
Why do all repeatative tasks by yourself, AI should handle it.

These are the tools that I use them daily in my workflow.

Coding and autocomplete
1. GitHub Copilot
2. Cursor IDE
3. Windsurf IDE
4. Google @Anti-gravity (Free)

Debugging and testing
5. @Jam.dev
6. CodiumAI – AI-assisted test generation for frontend and backend.

Code quality and reviews
7. CodeRabbit (Highly recommend)
8. Sourcery
9. Mintlify
10. CodeAnt AI

DevOps and automation
10. n8n
11. Terraform + AI plugins
12. AirOps / Runway

Learning and research
13. Perplexity
14. YouTube Summary with GPT
15. Pieces for Developers

    Tools are easy to list. The hard part is knowing when each one adds value vs. adds noise.

    I'd add: pick 2-3 that fit your workflow, get good at them, then expand. Trying all 15 at once leads to tool fatigue, not productivity.
  strategy: "Expert Insight - Adds practical wisdom about tool adoption rather than more suggestions. Aligns with 'figure out what works' theme."
```

## Notes

- Generic tools list post
- Low engagement (10 reactions)
- Comment adds differentiated value about tool selection strategy
