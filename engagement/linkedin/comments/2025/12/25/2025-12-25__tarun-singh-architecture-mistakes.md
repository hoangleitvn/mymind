  key_points:
    - Architecture is a decision-making system, not documentation
    - Technology should follow intent, not drive it
    - Design capabilities, not applications
    - Clarity > cleverness
    - Guardrails, not gates
    - Stability without evolution is decay
    - Measure by outcomes, not diagrams

## Original Post

Architecture Development: Common Mistakes to Avoid Most architecture failures don't happen suddenly. They happen quietly—through a series of reasonable decisions that compound over time. Here are the most common architecture mistakes I keep seeing across organizations:

1. Treating Architecture as Documentation
2. Starting with Technology Instead of Business
3. Designing Applications Instead of Capabilities
4. Assuming Change Is an Exception
5. Treating Non-Functionals as "Later Work"
6. Optimizing for Cleverness Over Clarity
7. Ignoring Team and Ownership Boundaries
8. Over-Centralizing Architectural Control
9. Letting Architecture Go Stale
10. Measuring Architecture by Diagrams, Not Outcomes

    Many EA practitioners lack real execution experience - they're fluent in frameworks but silent on execution.

    All costly mistakes.

    #6 is underrated - clever abstractions compound cognitive load.

    #1 hits hard - too many architects document what instead of why and trade-offs.

    The architecture that matters lives in the decisions, not the diagrams.
  strategy: "Amplify-add-insight - highlight #6 (cleverness) and #1 (documentation) with the what vs why insight"
```

## Notes

- Tarun later commented on our "10 Signs You Think Like an Architect" post
- Good mutual engagement - he added outcome ownership as potential #11
- Architecture failures happen quietly through compounding reasonable decisions
- Connects to our practical-engineering and architecture-thinking themes
