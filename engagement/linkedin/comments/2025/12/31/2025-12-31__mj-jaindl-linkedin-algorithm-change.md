## Original Post

LinkedIn changed. Most LinkedIn creators haven't. I've had to adapt to every algorithm shift. This one's the biggest. LinkedIn recently dropped 360Brew (their new algorithm update). Here's what's different (2025 → 2026): ❌ Old LinkedIn: • Follower count = reach • First hour = make or break • Video = easy reach hack • Comment volume wins • One format (carousels) dominated • Likes = success ✅ New LinkedIn: • Content depth = reach • Posts resurface for weeks • Video builds trust (not reach) • Comment quality wins (aim for 20-30/day) • Content variety rewarded • Saves = success The common thread? Quality wins. Everywhere. Quality content. Quality comments. Quality engagement. LinkedIn stopped rewarding breadth. And started rewarding depth. Adapt or get left behind. P.S. What's the biggest shift you've noticed on LinkedIn lately?

    This tracks 100%. The biggest shift I've noticed is delayed compounding. Good posts don't die in an hour anymore — they resurface because people save them, not because they smash like. Feels like LinkedIn finally started rewarding: • thinking > hacks • clarity > volume • usefulness > noise Depth over dopamine. Big win for creators who actually have something to say.

    Comment quality replacing volume raises the cost of shallow engagement. This favors operators willing to think beyond tactics and trends alone.

    Biggest shift I see is shallow posts dying faster while thoughtful niche posts keep pulling views and leads weeks later. Also noticing that consistent comments on a tight circle of relevant people now move the needle more than chasing viral reach.

    Thank you for sharing. That is why I measure my impact by the save and repost metric, focus on quality comment over quantity.
