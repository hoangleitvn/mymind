## Original Post

Pedro's post claiming teams shipping 5-10x faster with AI will outcompete perfectionists. Generating polarized responses with the 5-10x claim getting pushback.

    No, we still need a healthy skepticism. I have yet to see a team shipping anywhere near 5-10x faster.

    How is saying 5-10x faster not hype propagation? Many systems need stability over feature richness.

    No team is shipping 5-10x faster. At best 1.4-1.8x. Leaders need to focus on the whole delivery system.

    Keep doing what works best. We're already seeing results of AI coding, and it's painful to watch.

    The 5-10x claim will stay debatable. What's less debatable: the teams winning aren't the fastest or the most careful. They're the ones who figured out what to automate.

    We've found AI works best on the predictable parts (boilerplate, tests, docs) so humans can focus on the hard parts (architecture decisions, edge cases, user problems).

    The real question isn't speed vs quality. It's knowing which parts of your system can tolerate AI-assisted speed and which need human judgment.
  strategy: "Expert Insight - Adds nuance to polarized discussion by reframing from speed-vs-quality to what-to-automate"
```

## Notes

- Polarized responses - John Crickett's comment has 20 reactions challenging the 5-10x claim
- Comment section split between skeptics and believers
- Added nuanced perspective that doesn't dismiss AI gains or blindly accept hype
- Aligns with "foundation-first" and "build 20% that matters" philosophy
