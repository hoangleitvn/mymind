## Original Post

I'm posting this with 10 days left in 2025 because I'm battling imposter syndrome and about to do something crazy.

Here's my story.

In 2023, after struggling through our first year and only making $155k, I made a decision that changed everything.

I committed to receiving coaching - and it wasn't cheap.

That single decision took our business to 7 figures in 2024. We never looked back.

Looking back, I realize why I waited so long to invest in coaching: Accessibility.

I simply couldn't afford it.

So here's my crazy idea.

I'm opening up 7 spots to mentor and coach professionals who are serious about growing their business.

The cohort starts in February and runs for 8 weeks.

Here's what I need to address:

I see the hypocrisy. I'm saying coaching was too expensive for me, yet I'm not making this free.

But this will be the cheapest it will ever be.

I've invested five figures+ in coaching and business frameworks. I've taken our firm from $155k to 7 figures.

Now I want to share what actually worked.

This isn't about adding another course to your collection. It's about real accountability, real strategy, and real results.

1. Weekly KPI meetings
2. Growth playbooks
3. Your personal board of director

If you're ready to level up your business in 2025, this is your moment.

DM me "grow" if you're interested.

Let's finish this year strong and start the next one even stronger

P.S. Only 7 spots available. Keeping it small. I will be very intentional on who I accept.

P.P.S. Another crazy idea: I'm curious how much a cohort like this is worth to you per month? Maybe take the average of the answers as the starting point for the price point. Comment below and let me know.

P.P.P.S. This is something I wanted to do early this year but imposter syndrome talked me out of doing it every single time. Telling myself f*ck it. Let's go!

    9 days left. A few things I've been putting off are finally getting done.

    2026 will be harder - but that's the point.
  strategy: "Personal Experience - Shares relatable end-of-year push, reframes difficulty as intentional growth"
```

## Notes

- End of year reflection post
- Comment is personal and authentic
- Reframes "harder" as positive/intentional
