## Original Post

11 signs you have a growth mindset

(The top trait that separates top performers)

Information is power.
The more you know, the more you can help.
The more indispensable you become.

Top performers prioritize their growth.
Even if it happens outside of the office.
They make sure to always stay growing.

Here are 11 signs you're truly growth-oriented:

1/ You're not married to your opinions
↳ Ready to evolve when evidence changes

2/ You learn from everyone at work
↳ Even interns have unique wisdom to share

3/ You're energized by hard problems
↳ Challenges fuel your curiosity

4/ You connect unlikely dots
↳ You find lessons in unexpected places

5/ You study people who intimidate you
↳ And reverse engineer their success

6/ You're oddly comfortable with confusion
↳ Uncertainty signals growth ahead

7/ You start before you're ready
↳ Action beats endless planning

8/ You ask "basic" questions without hesitation
↳ Value learning over looking smart

9/ You get excited by others' success
↳ See it as proof of what's possible

10/ You collect failures like trophies
↳ Each one is a data point, not a defeat

11/ You deliberately seek hard feedback
↳ You know that's the only way to growth

Your mindset shapes everything else.
Small habits create massive results.

How do you stay growth-oriented?

  strategy: "Personal Experience - Reinforces specific point (#2 learning from juniors) with concrete observation from leadership experience"
