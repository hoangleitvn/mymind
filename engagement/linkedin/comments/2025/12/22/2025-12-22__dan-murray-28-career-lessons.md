## Original Post

Individuals must take ownership of their professional development rather than relying on employers.

**Document:** 30-page PDF carousel (image-based, not text-extractable)

    Solid list. Career is yours. No one will ask what you have or tell you what to do. Do it with intention. Learning, sharing, initiating. These compound faster than waiting for permission.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Reinforces ownership mindset, adds 'compounding' framing"
