    Well said. I'd add one more signal: architects take responsibility for outcomes, not just designs. Titles follow accountability. Mindset shows up the moment you start owning trade-offs, risks, and long-term consequences—often long before anyone calls you an architect.

    Exactly this! But I've lost count of the number of times I've been called awkward, a trouble maker, stop looking for problems, stop asking questions, for doing exactly this.

    Excellent!

    A warning about the "Good Enough" mindset. All too often, this becomes a blanket excuse for sloppy, careless work.

    Whatever you ship, ship with quality.

    Thank you for a good summary.. "Mindset" is the key attribute that differs a developer and an Architect

    I'd say that Architects looking at this as their domain is frankly, misguided…many disciplines express similar activities and similar outcomes…the key is to own our part, and in so doing, recognizing the contributions of others.

    When constructing teams, often made of individual contributors, we, as leaders, should be ready, willing, and able to help them understand the whole package and how each contribution matter. I do agree, the swim lanes are seen as firm/rigid boundaries, when really they should probably be seen as tidal land…not part of the sea or part of the land, but part of both, and we must be prepared to wander in there to get things done, but also to harvest value.

Spot on, the one that unlocks all the others. You can't explain tradeoffs (#6) if you don't own the consequences of getting them wrong.

I hear you. Speed cultures reward "how fast" and punish "why."

But the questions that slow you down today often prevent the rewrites that slow you down for months later. The trick is knowing which battles to pick.

The distinction matters. "Good enough" with a clear quality bar is intentional tradeoff. "Good enough" without one is just rationalized shortcuts.

The architect knows the difference. They can explain *why* this is good enough for now and *what* would break if pushed further.
  strategy: "Validate-clarify - he raised a valid caveat, clarify the distinction between intentional tradeoff vs. excuse"

I completely agree. Particularly in the early stage of designing an overall solution and gaining buy-in from executives, the architect won't know all the details and will become paralyzed if he or she looks for all the answers before moving forward.

However, the architect is also responsible for the overall integrity of the result, and, in that role, must guard against shortcuts that undermine the end result.

That said, whenever I hear the "good enough" mantra, it triggers a red flag. In my experience, many who rely on a "good enough" philosophy use it as an excuse. As a result, reports don't balance, exception processes fail, the user interface is inconsistent, and data bases go out of sync. If an architect fosters this environment, he or she must take responsibility for it.

Here's a simple example, and a test anyone can run. Recently, I've decided to change my phone number and my email address. I've used the old information for decades and it's time. In attempting to change these, more than two-thirds of the apps and web sites failed.
  insight: "Adds phone/email test as proof - 2/3 apps fail basic contact change. Red flag for 'good enough' as excuse."

The red flag is the right instinct. The difference is whether someone can explain: good enough for what? Until when? What breaks if pushed?

The architect who can answer those questions is making a tradeoff. The one who can't is making an excuse.

Exactly. The title follows the mindset, not the other way around.

I've seen senior devs with architect thinking and titled architects who still think in features. The role doesn't create the mindset.

Fair point. Product managers, designers, ops leads all think this way too. The mindset isn't exclusive to any title.

The post is aimed at engineers who wait for permission to think beyond their feature. The word "architect" is less about claiming territory and more about expanding scope of ownership.

Your framing is better: own your part, recognize others. That's the real skill.

The tidal land metaphor works. Rigid swim lanes create handoff culture. Flexible boundaries create ownership culture.

The best teams I've worked with treated boundaries as "you're responsible for this, but you can see and reach into that." Not permission to ignore scope - permission to care about the whole.

When ICs see the whole, they stop waiting for permission to care about more than their lane.
  strategy: "Build-on-metaphor - extend his tidal land concept, add IC perspective"

## Notes

- Tarun Singh added outcome ownership as potential #11 - previously engaged with his architecture mistakes post
- Tony K works in ship-fast culture where asking "why" gets pushback
- Jim McCauley raised valid caveat about "good enough" becoming excuse for sloppy work; replied with phone/email test as proof
- Bhanu Kishore Batchu (System Architect at Bosch) validates mindset as key differentiator
- Unknown pushed back on architect as exclusive domain - valid point, reframed intent
- Bill extended with "tidal land" metaphor for flexible boundaries vs rigid swim lanes
- Thread gaining traction with quality engagement from senior practitioners
