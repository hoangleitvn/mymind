## Original Post

How to build a production-ready multi-cloud Kubernetes platform. Dual reference architecture (AKS + EKS) with clear service mapping. Private-by-default networking, no public API endpoints. Enterprise security from day 1. IaC with Terraform and CloudFormation.

    Tarak, it's a gift of a post. Thanks for that! What I appreciate here is the discipline around true equivalence: private control planes, IAM parity, and service mapping are often where multi-cloud designs quietly drift. How do you decide where strict symmetry is worth the effort versus allowing intentional divergence as Azure and AWS features evolve?

    Most 'multi-cloud' posts stop at diagrams. This one actually maps the services and controls end-to-end (ACR vs ECR, Key Vault vs Secrets Manager/SSM, Log Analytics vs CloudWatch) with private control planes on both sides. That's the kind of baseline that survives security review and day-2 ops.

    This is solid work, especially the deliberate choice to treat AKS as the reference baseline while implementing EKS as a true first-class equivalent, not a 'best-effort' port. The service parity mapping (identity, registry, secrets, logging) and private-by-default control planes are where most multi-cloud initiatives quietly fail.

    That is a comprehensive and solid architecture for enterprise, especially focus on government with landing zone, secured by default, shift left security mindset. Curious: the diagram is generated by infracodebase?

    Both. Diagram-first forces engineers to follow, but it is often obsolete. And especially with AI, we also should have a task to design the architecture first, once the architecture is confirmed, then the agents do their job to write IaC. Autonomous creating IaC, generating diagrams and architecture documents also fine. But I would rather catch the design earlier and add missing pieces. That is how we work as humans; AI just speeds up. This is how I think.

    Reviewing code and compere is also challenging. That is why AWS built tools like AWS Perspective or AWS Workload Discovery for that purpose.

    I design in layers.

    Start with the logical architecture: what capabilities do we need? Compute, storage, networking, identity, observability. At this level, it's cloud-agnostic.

    Before drilling down, look at design constraints and principles. Cost, compliance, team expertise, performance requirements, existing investments. These guide the selection.

    Then the physical layer: which cloud, which services, which configurations. ACR vs ECR, Key Vault vs Secrets Manager. The architecture intent is already validated before we get here.

    Vendor-agnostic is good to evaluate, but not always practical. Sometimes the cloud-specific tool is just better for the job. I still use AWS Perspective and Workload Discovery for visualizing and generating diagrams. They solve real problems.

    Honestly, still exploring how to manage this better. No perfect answer yet.
  strategy: "Expert Insight - layered approach (logical, constraints/principles, physical), acknowledge nuance on vendor-agnostic, honest about ongoing learning"
```

## Notes

- Tarak shared comprehensive guide on multi-cloud Kubernetes platform (AKS + EKS)
- Key focus: security-first, private-by-default, with IaC that actually runs
- Infracodebase generates diagrams from real infrastructure context
- Diagram-first vs code-first debate - both approaches have value
- AI in architecture workflow - design first, then agents write IaC
- Tool lock-in concern - Tarak prefers flexibility over single-cloud tooling
