  thesis: "Building an AI SaaS solo without a dev background is possible now. The hardest part isn't code - it's understanding the problem, choosing what not to build, and keeping things simple."
  insight: "Tools like Cursor enable non-technical founders to ship. The real skill is prioritization through subtraction."
  their_angle: "Non-technical founder perspective on building with AI tools"
  our_opening: "Reinforce 'what not to build' insight - aligns with our 'build 20% that matters' and 'discovery is hard' themes"

  theme: "product-development"
  key_points:
    - Tools enable speed for non-technical founders
    - Simplicity over features
    - Removing layers matters more than adding them
    - Learning through building in public

AI made building cheap. That doesn't change what's worth building. When anyone can ship an MVP in a weekend, the differentiator is discovery, not development.

The temptation with fast tools is to add everything you can build. The discipline is shipping the 20% that matters and letting users tell you what's next.

Most products die from addition, not subtraction.
