  thesis: "Prompt engineering is dead. The shift is from prompt engineering to flow engineering - agentic workflows."
  insight: "Old model + agentic workflow (95.1%) outperformed new GPT zero-shot (67%). Same model, different architecture."
  their_angle: "Flow engineering replaces prompt engineering"
  our_opening: "Connect to workflow first, skills second, tools follow"

  theme: "ai-workflows"
  key_points:
    - Agentic workflows beat better models
    - From prompting to managing digital teams
    - Architecture matters more than model

The data tells the whole story. Workflow beats model.

Prompt engineering didn't die. It evolved from "magic phrases" to "context and constraints." The skill now is architecture, not wordsmithing.

Workflow first, skills second, tools and models follow. The 95.1% came from better architecture, not a better model.

Well said. The data makes the shift undeniable. Workflow beats raw model strength because architecture carries the intelligence forward. Prompting did not vanish. It matured. The real craft now is designing context, constraints and the chain behind the output.

Agreed. Curious - what's the biggest blocker you've seen when teams try to make this shift? The tooling is there, but most still default to single prompts.

One of the biggest blockers is mindset. Teams think prompting is the work. They never slow down to map decisions, checkpoints, and ownership. Once the work is decomposed, the shift becomes obvious. Until then, the model stays trapped in a single turn.

Your comment is spot on! To say Prompt engineering is dead is very misleading! Prompt Engineering itself is the foundation of interacting with Generative AI models, it is a skill that needs to be learned.

Agreed - it's evolved, not dead. The foundation is still there. The skill now is knowing what context and constraints to provide, not just the prompt itself.

"Teams think prompting is the work" - that's the core blocker.

Prompting is just execution. The real skills happen before you touch the model: framing the problem, breaking it into steps, knowing what good looks like.

Most teams skip straight to prompting without the setup work.

## Thread Summary

**Our comment:** Workflow beats model. Prompt engineering evolved from magic phrases to context and constraints. Workflow first, skills second, tools follow.

**His reply:** Agreed. Architecture carries intelligence forward. The craft is now designing context, constraints, and the chain behind the output.

**Our follow-up:** Asked about the biggest blocker when teams try to make this shift.

**His answer:** Mindset. Teams think prompting IS the work. They don't slow down to map decisions, checkpoints, ownership. Once decomposed, the shift becomes obvious.

**Jabaree Allen:** Agreed with us - prompt engineering is a foundation skill, not dead.

**Our reply to Jabaree:** Agreed - evolved, not dead. The skill is context and constraints.

**Our reply to Michael:** Prompting is just execution. The real skills (framing, decomposition, evaluation) happen before you touch the model. (Holding back the 5-skill framework for dedicated post.)
