Curious about the timing. At what point did you feel confident enough to start building?

Was there a signup threshold that told you "okay, this is real"? Or did you start building in parallel while the audience grew?

That makes sense. I went the other way - built for myself first, now expanding the feedback circle through alpha testing. Different path, same goal: don't code too much before someone tells you what's wrong.

## Thread Summary

**Our question:** When did signups translate to confidence to build?

**His reply:** Parallel marketing and building. Signups are vanity metrics. Proto + feedback is the real validation. Early marketing creates DM conversations with people willing to help before you over-build.

**Our reply:** Different path (built for self first, now alpha testing), same goal (feedback before over-building).
