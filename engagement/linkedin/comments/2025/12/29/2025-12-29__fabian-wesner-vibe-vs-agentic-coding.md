## Original Post

Over the last months I developed a pretty clear picture about different approaches to AI coding:

**Vibe Coding** - Iterative, prompt-based development ("Make this button green"). Easy entry, instant visual feedback. Limitations emerge with complexity and inconsistent code quality.

**Agentic Software Engineering** - Structured, semi-automated workflow. 10x productivity boost possible, enterprise suitable. Requires weeks of practice to master.

Three core techniques:
1. Spec-Driven Development - Human specifications as primary artifacts; code becomes generated consequence
2. Knowledge & Guardrails - System documentation and coding conventions ensure consistent output
3. Tools & MCPs - Agents interact with applications like human developers

Neither approach universally superior. Vibe coding excels for exploration and speed; agentic methods suit complexity and maintainability.

    Spec-driven is where the leverage is. Vibe coding optimizes for speed. Spec-driven optimizes for intent clarity.

    The missing piece: knowing when to switch.

    Quick exploration? Vibe code. Anything that ships to users? Spec first. The cost of switching modes is lower than the cost of wrong mode.
  strategy: "Reinforce spec-driven angle, add practical 'when to switch' framework that connects to AI coding levels post"
```

## Notes

- Fabian Wesner (8.2K followers) - good technical audience
- Post aligns with our AI coding levels and spec-first themes
- "Human specifications as primary artifacts" = our "architect before AI executes" angle
- Connects to "10 Signs Using AI Right" (points 1, 2) and "Levels of AI Coding" post
- Content seed: "The cost of wrong mode" as a hook for future content
