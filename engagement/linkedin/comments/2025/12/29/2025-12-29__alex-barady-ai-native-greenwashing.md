Good framework. The gap between beginner and mid-level is where most teams get stuck.

I frame it differently - focused on workflow and mindset, not skills and tools:

0/ "AI writes bad code" (judging by your standards)
1/ "AI assists my coding" (autocomplete)
2/ "AI writes code I review" (prompt-generate-fix)
3/ "AI follows my instructions" (HOW)
4/ "AI solves my problem" (WHAT + WHY)
5/ "AI reasons about the system" (context + constraints)

The hardest jump is 3 to 4: trusting the model to figure out HOW when you only give WHAT and WHY.

Most teams have the tooling for Level 4. They don't have the mindset.
