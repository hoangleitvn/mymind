Tools give you the what. Workflow gives you the how. Mindset gives you the why.

Most people focus on Level 1-2 (which tools to learn). The real gap is knowing when to use them and how to validate outputs.

Roadmaps help. But the engineers who move fastest aren't learning more tools - they're building better judgment about when AI helps and when it doesn't.
