## Original Post

Jordan argues that AI-augmented coding resolves the traditional tension in software development between speed and quality. Claims: "I can do it 'right' and also do it 'fast'" with AI tools.

    I am finding that I can better manage my tech debt and "do it right" now!

    Vs. doing it right "some day", which never comes?

    This. The idea that code can be ephemeral is a hard mental model shift that most cannot—will not—make.

    AI boosts velocity, but the tension doesn't disappear. It just shifts debt categories.

    You can ship "right and fast" on code. But AI often increases verification debt, understanding debt, decision debt, and ops debt unless you add tests, evals, and traceability.

    Fast typing is solved. Confidence, correctness, and maintainability still cost.

    Fair point. I also see code as ephemeral and liability. "Someday" kills more codebases than bad architecture.

    Timothy's right about the mental shift. When regenerating is cheaper than maintaining, debt math changes. Then I think now we should ask: what's worth keeping vs. what's worth regenerating?

## Notes

- Jordan is a regular engagement target (see people/jordan-dea-mattson.md)
- Good thread with quality discussion on AI development philosophy
- Timothy Ruff: Principal @ Digital Trust Venture Partners, Co-founder Evernym - worth tracking if he engages further
- Key question emerged: What's worth keeping vs regenerating when rewrite is cheaper than maintain?
- Connects to "code is liability" principle from our content themes
