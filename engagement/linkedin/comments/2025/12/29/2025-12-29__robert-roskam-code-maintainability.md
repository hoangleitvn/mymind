    That dear friend is usually future you. And future you has no memory of why you did it that way.

    The real artifact isn't the code. It's the context: specs, decisions, constraints. Code can be regenerated. The reasoning behind it can't.

    If you had to rebuild from scratch tomorrow, what would you wish you'd documented?
  strategy: "Build on classic advice, add AI regeneration angle - specs/context as the real reusable artifact"
```

## Notes

- Robert Roskam (13K followers) - second engagement after containers/WASM post
- Lower engagement post (15 likes) - good visibility opportunity
- Our angle: shifts from "maintain code" to "specs/context survive regeneration"
- Connects to ephemeral code theme, spec-driven development
- Content seed: "What survives regeneration?" as hook for future content
- Question at end invites engagement
