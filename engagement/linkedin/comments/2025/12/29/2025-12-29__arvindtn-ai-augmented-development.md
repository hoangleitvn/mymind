  thesis: "AI hasn't replaced engineers but repositioned their value. Success requires changing team workflows, not just adopting better tools."
  insight: "Four practices for AI-augmented teams: treat AI output as untrusted code, refocus reviews on architecture/security/intent, make accountability explicit with named owners, track quality metrics beyond velocity."
  their_angle: "The solution to AI quality concerns is workflow change, not tool improvement"
  our_opening: "The accountability/ownership point - aligns with our engineering leadership theme"

  theme: "ai-augmented-development"
  key_points:
    - Treat AI output as untrusted external code
    - Shift code reviews from syntax to intent/architecture/security
    - Named owner per AI-assisted change with disclosure in PRs
    - Track defect leakage, production issues, maintenance effort beyond velocity

The accountability point is what most teams skip. They add AI tools, keep the same review process, and wonder why quality drops.

Named ownership per change works because it forces engineers to actually read what AI generated before merging. When someone's name is on the PR, they verify. Without that, AI output gets rubber-stamped.

What resistance have you seen when introducing the disclosure requirement?

## Alternative Comment

Strategy: Add experience on metrics

```
The metrics shift separates teams that use AI well from teams that just use AI.

We track time-to-production-issue now, not just velocity. Faster PRs mean nothing if you're debugging AI hallucinations in production two weeks later.

Are you seeing teams resist the expanded metrics? Velocity is easier to celebrate than defect leakage.
