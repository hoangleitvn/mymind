  thesis: "Stop blaming AI for ugly UIs. The failure isn't AI - it's lack of visual discipline."
  insight: "Specific constraints (one font, 4/8px spacing, greyscale first) create controlled output. AI without discipline produces chaos."
  their_angle: "Design systems and constraints before AI generation"
  our_opening: "Same tools, different results - connects to our AI adoption theme and 'know what good looks like'"

  theme: "ai-tools"
  key_points:
    - AI isn't the problem, lack of discipline is
    - Use design systems and constraints
    - Reduce colors, lock spacing, one font family
    - Design in greyscale first

This is the same pattern everywhere AI touches.

Same tools. Wildly different results. The difference is whether the human knows what "good" looks like before prompting.

AI amplifies existing skill. If you lack design discipline, AI produces undisciplined designs. If you lack architecture thinking, AI produces spaghetti code. The tool isn't the variable.
