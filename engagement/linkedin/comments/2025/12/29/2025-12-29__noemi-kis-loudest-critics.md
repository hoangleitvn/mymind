  thesis: "The loudest critics are usually the least qualified. Evaluate advice by the source's results."
  insight: "Would I trade places with this person? If no, their criticism is just noise."
  their_angle: "Filter feedback by source credibility, not volume"
  our_opening: "Simple agreement for visibility - high follower account"

  theme: "personal-growth"
  key_points:
    - Loud critics often haven't taken risks themselves
    - Take advice from people living the life you want
    - Qualified critics are too busy succeeding to tear others down
