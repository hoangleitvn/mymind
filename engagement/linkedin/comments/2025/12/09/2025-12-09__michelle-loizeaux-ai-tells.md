## Original Post

Recommendation to anyone using AI to generate your LinkedIn posts: edit out the gratuitous em dashes and incomplete clauses before prime time. You're giving yourself away. I have no issue with using AI to improve your work (I do it often), but if you're trying to pass off AI insights as your own, at least get rid of its very obvious tells.

    Em dashes are the easy tell. The harder ones to catch: "In a world where...", "Most people do X, but the successful few...", "not just X, but Y". I learned these from other people, combined all the writing rules, and force AI to not use them.
  strategy: "Insightful Addition - Adds more AI patterns beyond em dashes, honest about using AI with rules"
```

## Notes

- Relevant to my writing-rules.md which has banned patterns
- Good timing to be honest about AI usage after Jack Rudenko exchange
- Added value by listing more patterns beyond just em dashes
