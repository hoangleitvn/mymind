## Original Post

Our Stanford class "CME 295: Transformers & Large Language Models" is now available on YouTube! My twin brother Afshine Amidi and I are teaching the class this Fall, which is being recorded. Topics of the class include: - Transformers (tokenization, embeddings, attention mechanism, architecture) - LLM foundations (definition, MoEs, types of decoding) - LLM training and tuning (supervised/reinforcement finetuning, LoRA) - LLM evaluation (LLM/VLM-as-a-judge and best practices) - Common tricks (RoPE, attention approximation, quantization) - Reasoning (train/test-time scaling, context awareness) - Agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) Videos are made available on the Stanford YouTube channel over the course of the quarter. Happy learning!

    Thank you for making this available. I'm going to study at Stanford now.

    These are the foundational concepts that help engineers understand how AI/LLM works, and best practices for building real-world AI systems.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Personal appreciation with practical value highlight"
