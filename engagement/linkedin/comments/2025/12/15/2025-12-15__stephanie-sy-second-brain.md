    Agreed. Build your workflow, your system to connect first brain with AI.

    Then AI helps us find blind spots and build the Second Brain.

    Without the first brain foundation, you're just outsourcing thinking.
  strategy: "Supportive agreement - reinforces the 'first brain first' message, adds workflow angle"
```
