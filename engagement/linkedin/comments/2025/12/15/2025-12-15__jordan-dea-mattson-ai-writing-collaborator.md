## Original Post

I thought I was a good writer. Then I started using Claude as writing collaborator. Claude solved the blank page problem - 0th draft to react to. AI writing WITH me, not FOR me. Mirror effect - seeing patterns in own writing. Augmentation, not automation.

    AI is much better as a coach/collaborator than it is as an individual contributor!

    I don't want to become a professional writer. I just want to share more effectively.

    AI helps me find my blind spots. Patterns I couldn't see in my own writing - same as you, Jordan Dea-Mattson.

    I can do it without AI. But it's a matter of time I'd rather spend elsewhere.

    Augmentation, not automation. Exactly right. FYI, I haven't thought about setting up the automated write -> publish -> engage workflow yet, and I hope I won't.
  strategy: "Personal experience - connects to Jordan's augmentation framing, honest about goals"
```

## Notes

- Jordan shares his experience using Claude as writing collaborator
- Key insight: AI as mirror to see your own patterns
- "Augmentation, not automation" is his core message
- Validated the augmentation framing with similar perspective
