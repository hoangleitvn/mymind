## Original Post

New AI Agent framework from Stanford is making people crazy What does it actually do? Let's see behind the hype... What exactly does Agent0 do? - True Zero-Data Self-Evolution that too without humans. Yes, that means no labels. No curated tasks. No demonstrations. Just two agents locked in co-evolution, teaching each other to solve increasingly complex problems using code. Like an actual collaboration between two software engineers. But we already had RL and even RLHF, why is this stronger? Well, Agents trained with RL are fundamentally constrained by their heavy reliance on massive, high-quality, human-curated datasets. This dependency creates severe scalability bottlenecks and restricts the potential of AI to the limits of human knowledge and annotation speed. That's when we come in and spend the majority of our time annotating the mistakes made by the AI. Agent0 completely eliminates this dependency, evolving the agent entirely from scratch with zero external data. So yes, Agent0 seems to be a major shift and can reduce the training cost of agents and models by major numbers. If I have to summarize, then here's what Agent0 stands for: ✅ Zero-Data Autonomy: Fully autonomous co-evolution from scratch, eliminating dependency on external data or human annotations. ✅ Virtuous Cycle: 1:1 competition where Tool Integration actively drives curriculum complexity, rewarding the generation of progressively harder, tool-aware tasks. ✅ Massive Gains: Achieved up to 18% improvement on mathematical reasoning and 24% improvement on general reasoning (Qwen3-8B-Base). ✅ State-of-the-Art: Outperforms leading data-free baselines like R-Zero (+6.4%) and Absolute Zero (+10.6%).

Honest take: I don't fully understand what problem Agent0 solves yet, but saving this for future evaluation. Thanks for breaking it down.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement with honesty - acknowledging complexity while showing appreciation"
