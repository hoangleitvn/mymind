## Original Post

How I get > 30% replies via LinkedIn DMs By doing the opposite of the 100+ weekly pitches I get: CONTEXT I sent 5M+ outbound messages for my $6.5M+ ARR Agency. Nowadays... Answering DMs costs me more time than running campaigns. I'm the CEO at a 33-person company. (I can't imagine how much outreach execs in big orgs get) That said, I know most execs check their inbox. And many reply. Here's how I decide whether I'll respond or not... And how I changed my own outreach because of this ↓ ✅ DMs offering free work Some DMs offered a free landing page rewrite or samples of already-made work. I ran prospecting campaigns and pitched free custom lead lists. (These were getting me more positive replies than I could handle) My recommendation: Imagine your prospect is an existing client. What's the first thing you'll do for them? Do it already and send it over! ✅ DMs asking to be referred Let's say you: 1. Send a message based on a current initiative of ColdIQ 2. Searched who is in charge of this initiative. ↳ I'll gladly refer you to said person PS: You can automate this 'play' via Clay by combining intent signals & retrieving a leader/manager in a specific department. ❌ DMs asking for time on the 1st touchpoint Meetings are my personal hell. I'm fighting every day to eliminate as many of them as possible. If you're "just asking 15 min of my time" to pick my brain, I won't answer. ✅ DMs from 'known' people An unfair truth in cold outreach: $WHO sends a message matters even more than WHAT the message is. If you're a well-known executive, I'll most likely reply. I saw this firsthand as I grew my LinkedIn to 60K+ followers... The exact same message would perform better, without changing anything. Pro tip: If you sell B2B products, build your brand on LinkedIn. ❌ Generic templated outreach The only way to make impersonal, generic outreach work is to send at a massive volume (millions of messages). LinkedIn doesn't allow such volume. So you'd be better off doing this by email. Or better yet... not at all. ✅ DMs sharing valuable insights Jihad explained this better than I could under one of my posts: " The best "free work" isn't actually work → it's insights. I send technical audits of prospects' platforms. → 5-minute analysis → 3 specific optimization opportunities → No strings attached Example: "Your checkout flow has a 23% drop-off at payment verification. Here's why + 2 quick fixes." - Takes me 10 minutes. - Shows immediate value. - Demonstrates expertise without asking for anything. The key: Make it so valuable they'd typically pay for it. Generic "free consultation" = everyone does this. Specific actionable insight = rare. " Solving prospects' issues before they pay you a dime is the fastest way to gain their trust. 🔘 Videos or Voice Notes I listen to voice notes or watch videos. It annoys people. But if they're well done, they'll grab attention. What's a DM you receive you could NOT ignore? Share it 👇

We crossed $6,000,000 ARR thanks to LinkedIn. Here's why everyone at ColdIQ posts here... LinkedIn Content helps with both brand awareness and trust. And when your entire team posts as well… The impact is… exponential.

Agree on the 'don't ask for time' part nothing kills a DM faster than a calendar link on message one.

Agreed. DM works best when they already know you. Keep it simple, skip the templates.

My approach: comment first to get on their radar, then DM if they engage or seem curious. Cold DM to strangers rarely works.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement + Personal insight - reinforcing his points while adding own approach"
