  theme: "AI agents democratize MVP building but create knowledge gaps"
  angle: "Living specs needed to bridge MVP to production"
  key_points:
    - AI coding agents let more people build MVPs
    - Big gap remains for production readiness, complex features, integrations
    - Knowledge gets lost - debugging, explaining, designing all start from scratch
    - Need "living specs" that persist context and decisions
    - Software management must evolve with building tools

## Original Post

AI coding agents have changed how startups spawn. They make it so that more people than ever can take steps to make their vision a reality. Before, if you didn't know how to code or didn't have time and space, you couldn't really make progress on building. Now, spinning up an MVP is actually attainable for most people. Huge strides.

However, there's still a big gap when trying to take the next step: production readiness, complex features, integrations... these turn into games of whack-a-mole fast.

Startups need living specs. You write them to guide the coding agent, the coding agent even generates its own collateral. But all that info is lost. When you're debugging, you start from scratch. When investors ask you how your software works, you start from scratch. When you're designing new features, again... you start from scratch.

The way we manage software, understand software, monitor software, it all has to evolve as our tools to build evolve.

    This is the foundation gap. AI agents are great at generating code, but they don't build understanding.

    I've seen teams ship MVPs in days, then spend months debugging because no one knows why the code works the way it does. The "start from scratch" problem compounds fast.

    What's working for us: treat AI-generated specs as first drafts, not artifacts. Someone on the team still needs to own the "why" behind the code.
  strategy: "Experience + Practical Addition - Validates her observation with real experience, adds concrete practice ('own the why'), ties to foundation-first philosophy without being preachy."
```

## Notes

- Smaller account (1.5K followers) but relevant topic
- Early post (7 reactions, 4 comments) - good timing for visibility
- Aligns with "foundation-first" and knowledge capture themes
- Comments already discussing version control - our angle adds human ownership layer
