## Original Post

Tips for AI-assisted software development: All code is a liability. Don't add code unless the value is greater than the liability. Every line of code you add carries a future cost. Code needs maintenance, upgrades, debugging, and shared team context. More code also increases complexity, raises the risk of bugs, and slows you down over time.

Key points to remember:
- Every line of code you write needs ongoing maintenance
- The best code is the code you never have to write - leverage existing tools or libraries
- More code creates more places for bugs to hide
- Code starts aging the moment you ship it
- Deleting code often delivers real value
- Code you don't add to the product can never break in production
- Team cognitive load is limited so keep things simple
- Dependencies bring hidden risk and extra upkeep
- Code is expensive to change but cheap to defer

Regarding dependencies and hidden risk... Apparently a new type of attack is doing the rounds known as slopsquatting

I'm actually not sure about this one... If in 10 years the AI will write and maintain the TypeScript source code, then does this advice still make sense?

More code == more surface area for bugs. The problem I've seen is that AI tools lean towards code bloat

    This is why I think AI in software engineering is a snowball, not a bubble. Teams add AI-generated code faster than they can validate it. The liability compounds when no one fully understands what got added.

    Simple fix: if you can't explain it, you don't ship it. One filter, big impact on keeping the codebase understandable.
  strategy: "Experience + Practical Addition - Extends the code liability concept to AI-generated code specifically, adds concrete team practice, ties to 'AI snowball' angle."
```
