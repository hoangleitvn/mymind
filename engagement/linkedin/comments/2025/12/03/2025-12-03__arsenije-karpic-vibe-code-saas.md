## Original Post

Why pay a tool $300 a month when you can vibe code your own for $24k+?

I see this one everywhere in my feed.

My take is that if you have time to vibe code an internal tool you can pay 10-30$ / user / month, you are not focusing on the right things.

Yeah, I think it's a control thing. Maybe their internal engineer is trying to replace all their tools so they can justify their existence.

The game is changing. And that will come with lessons on both sides of the wall.

    The math gets worse when you count maintenance. That $24K build becomes $24K + ongoing bugs + security patches + "why did it break" debugging sessions.

    SaaS tools externalize that liability. The vibe-coded version makes it your problem forever.

    Build what differentiates your product. Buy everything else.
  strategy: "Experience + Extension - Extends his point with the hidden costs (maintenance, liability), ties to 'code is liability' theme, ends with clear principle."
