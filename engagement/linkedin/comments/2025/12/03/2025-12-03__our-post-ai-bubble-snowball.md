I'll firmly push that 'Weather' AI is no snow ball 😁 The model's which Jua.ai develop with ML are industry leading in weather forecasting

    Thanks Vembarasan. The bubble debate will continue, but for builders the snowball is the immediate problem. What patterns are you seeing in your teams?
  strategy: "Appreciative + invite deeper conversation with question"

    Fair push. Weather forecasting with rigorous ML is exactly the kind of AI worth building on. Validated models, measurable accuracy, real outcomes.

    My concern is narrower: the 36% skipping tests and shipping unreviewed code. That's the snowball.

    Teams doing the hard work properly (like Jua.ai sounds) are the opposite of the problem.
  strategy: "Acknowledge valid counterpoint, clarify scope (vibe coding ≠ all AI), respect expertise"
```
