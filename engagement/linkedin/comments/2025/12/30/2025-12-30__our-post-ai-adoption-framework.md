## Original Post

See source_file for full content.

Key message: The tool is 20% of the outcome. The workflow is 80%.
Framework: Workflow → Skills → Guardrails → Tools

Hoang Spot on! Focusing on the workflow before the tool is the only way to avoid those compounding errors. It is so true that tools are only a small part of the equation while the process handles the heavy lifting.

Onifade-Esan Modupeola Bolaji Appreciate this. The compounding errors point is exactly what we're trying to prevent. Which step has been the hardest in your experiences: workflow mapping, skills, guardrails, or tool fit?

## Response Templates

Based on Post 1's topic (workflow-first AI adoption), here are response templates for common comment types:

### Template A: Agreement/Endorsement Comment

For comments like "Great framework" or "I agree with this approach":

```
Thanks [Name]. The pattern is remarkably consistent once you start looking for it.

Curious: which of the failure modes (Marketing/Finance/Engineering) have you seen most often in your experience?

The article breaks down practical steps for each - link in first comment if useful.
```

### Template B: Sharing Experience Comment

For comments sharing their own AI adoption challenges:

```
[Name] - that's exactly the pattern. [Reference their specific example].

The gap between "we have the tools" and "we're getting value" usually comes down to workflow clarity.

We documented specific guardrails in the full article that might help with [their situation].
```

### Template C: Question About Implementation

For "how do I start?" or methodology questions:

```
Good question, [Name].

The article has a 4-week adoption plan that starts with workflow mapping before touching tools. Week 1 is entirely about documenting how work actually flows.

Link in first comment - the practical steps section might help.
```

### Template D: Counterpoint/Challenge

For pushback like "tools matter more than you suggest":

```
Valid pushback, [Name]. Tools definitely aren't irrelevant.

The 80/20 framing is about sequence: workflow clarity makes tool selection clearer and adoption faster.

Teams that map workflows first tend to make better tool choices and see results sooner. But you're right that the tool still matters.

What's your experience been?
```

### Template E: Industry-Specific Comment

For comments about specific industries (healthcare, finance, etc.):

```
[Name] - [industry] is particularly interesting because [reference their point].

The compliance/audit requirements actually make workflow-first even more critical. You need the guardrails documented before the tools touch anything.

We included some industry patterns in the article - would be curious if they match what you're seeing.
```
