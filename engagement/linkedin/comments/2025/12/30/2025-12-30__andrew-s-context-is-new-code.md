  theme: "ai-architecture"
  key_points:
    - Black boxes to glass boxes for AI legibility
    - Just-in-time context vs shoving whole repo
    - MCP for structured access to infrastructure and observability
    - Most valuable engineers design systems easiest for AI to understand

Context density without context clarity is just more noise to hallucinate through.

The engineers who matter won't write the most code. They'll make systems legible to other systems.

Legibility isn't just about MCP or context protocols. It's about architecture decisions that create obvious boundaries, clear ownership, and explicit constraints.

Good architecture was always about reducing cognitive load. Now it's about reducing inference load too.

Tools like MCP help. But the work starts earlier: defining the workflow, building the skills, creating knowledge systems that both AI and humans can navigate.

## Thread Summary

**His post:** Context is the new code. Engineers need to move from writing code to Engineering Context. Uses MCP as "USB-C port for context" - glass boxes over black boxes, just-in-time retrieval, architecting for agency.

**Our comment:** Context density without clarity is noise. Legibility is about architecture decisions, not just protocols. Good architecture reduces cognitive load; now it reduces inference load too. But the work starts before tools: workflow, skills, knowledge systems.
