Exactly. Execution got cheaper. Judgment got more valuable.

The engineers who thrive now are the ones who can tell AI what to build, not just ask AI to build something. That requires the system thinking and ownership you mentioned.

## Thread Summary

**Alex Palau:** #8 ownership is key - you're responsible for what you ship regardless of who/what wrote it.

**Ha Nguyen:** Simple agreement.

**Ali Khan:** AI handles execution, but judgment, system thinking, ownership define real engineers.

**INNOMIZE:** #5 and #6 are hiring signals - knowing "done" before coding = engineer.

**Our reply to Ali Khan:** Execution got cheaper, judgment got more valuable. Engineers who can tell AI what to build, not just ask it to build.
