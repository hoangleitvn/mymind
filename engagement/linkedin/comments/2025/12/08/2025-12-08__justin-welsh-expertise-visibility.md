    We spend years mastering the craft but almost no time mastering visibility. Treat visibility as a daily practice.

    Lived this from the engineering side. Spent years building products, scaling teams, solving hard technical problems. Stayed invisible.

    The shift for me: realizing that the same skills I used to "sell" architecture decisions to stakeholders could be applied to myself.

    Technical founders often think visibility is for marketers. It's not. It's the bridge between what you've built and who needs to find it.
  strategy: "Personal Experience - Connects his creator/sales angle to technical founder audience. Adds engineering lens while validating core message."
```

## Notes

- High visibility opportunity (810K+ followers, 1.5K reactions)
- Message aligns with our positioning (founders need to bridge expertise with visibility)
- Connects to technical founder audience (engineering version of his point)
- Previous engagement with Justin Welsh - building recognition
