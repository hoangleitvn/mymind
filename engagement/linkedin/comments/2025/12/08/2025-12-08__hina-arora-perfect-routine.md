## Original Post

Hina Arora contrasts her ideal daily routine (6 AM wake-up, yoga, LinkedIn networking, ending at 10 PM) with reality - acknowledging this "perfect day" happens "maybe once a quarter."

Core message: "Every day doesn't have to be perfect. You don't have to be your best self every day to be successful." Showing up despite imperfection matters most.

  content: |
    The gap between "ideal routine" and "actual routine" doesn't matter. What matters is you still did it.

    Some people plan the perfect morning and never start. You showed up. That's the momentum that compounds.
  strategy: "Supportive Agreement - Validates point, reframes gap as irrelevant, emphasizes action over perfection"
```

## Notes

- Large audience (300K followers) but general career/productivity content
- Less aligned with core engineering themes but good for visibility
- Message aligns with "ship over perfect" philosophy
