## Original Post

I've noticed more candidates using AI during technical tests lately, and I think it's a good thing. If a tool helps you move faster and focus on problem solving, why wouldn't you use it? But there's one part that still matters a lot. You need to take ownership of the work you submit. Sometimes I'll review a test and the code looks like it came straight from an AI prompt. Comments don't match the logic. A function is there but never actually used. The explanation sounds confident but misses important detail. You can tell the person hasn't fully read what they pasted. On the other side, when someone uses AI well, it's obvious too. They tidy up the output. They make sure it solves the right problem. They explain the thinking behind their choices. The code feels like something they would write in a real team environment. AI can help you get there faster. But the quality still comes from you. So if you're using AI in a tech test, quick tip: give it that extra bit of attention. Make it something you'd be proud to share with your future teammates.

    No matter how you produce the code, you own it, you control it. If you don't understand it, don't ship it.

    We can't tell engineers to stop using AI because we can't validate how they work. But we can expect them to validate the output.

    This creates a new kind of debt alongside technical debt: validation debt. Code that works but nobody fully understands. It compounds fast.

    AI is a snowball. It amplifies whatever is already there, good habits or bad ones.
  strategy: "Insightful Addition - Introduces 'validation debt' concept, ties to AI snowball theme from published content"
