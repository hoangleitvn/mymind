## Original Post

**Headline:** "ChatGPT used to feel like magic. Lately it feels like MS Explorer with a personality."

**Main Complaint:** Adam expresses disappointment with ChatGPT's recent performance, noting it "used to feel sharp, fast, and reliable" but now causes frustration daily with argumentative responses and inaccurate answers delivered confidently.

**Shift in Tool Usage:** Despite being a loyal user who typically sticks with proven solutions, he's begun exploring competing LLMs including Gemini, which is gaining unexpected traction.

**Strategic Critique:** OpenAI appears distracted, spreading resources across multiple projects (Sora, Operator, Codex, DALL-E, Whisper, Atlas) while their core product deteriorates. "It would be impressive if their main product wasn't regressing."

**Cultural Observation:** Contrasts ChatGPT's former startup agility with its current corporate appearance, suggesting they've lost focus on fundamentals despite their YC heritage.

**Warning Signal:** When non-early-adopter users begin switching platforms, it signals meaningful market momentum shift.

    Same experience here. GPT responses lately feel like they lost context mid-conversation. More time prompting, less time building.

    Moved my coding work to Claude. Focus matters, both for the tools and the teams building them.
  strategy: "Personal Experience + Expert Insight - Validate frustration with own experience, share tool switch, close with product insight"
```

## Notes

- Post resonates with common frustration among AI tool users
- Aligns with product development theme: focus vs feature sprawl
- Good opportunity to share perspective without being preachy
- Comments mention Claude preference - validates quality focus narrative
