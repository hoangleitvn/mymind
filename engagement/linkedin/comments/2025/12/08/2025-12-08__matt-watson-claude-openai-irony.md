    Claude Code is basically agent. It does a lot of things other than just being an LLM. I have seen people using Gemini as LLM behind Claude Code.

    All the time. Claude Code writing OpenAI integrations, then asking ChatGPT to debug Claude's output.

    The tools don't care about brand loyalty. Neither should we.
  strategy: "Personal Experience (light) - Matches casual tone. Adds relatable twist. Reframes irony as pragmatism."
```
