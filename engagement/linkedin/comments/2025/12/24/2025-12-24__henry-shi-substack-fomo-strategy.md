## Original Post

I grew to 5-figure ARR and 12,000+ subscribers in 6 months on Substack by writing only 1-2 times a month and never posting a single Note. Here are my top secret tips and hacks: Everyone thinks you need to be active on Substack and post 3 notes every day, but I discovered something different. I tested a counterintuitive publishing strategy that created massive FOMO. Within weeks, my conversion rates skyrocketed. Here's exactly what I did: I started writing valuable medium to long-form content directly relevant to my audience's current challenges. Quality matters more than frequency, so I did not have a strict publishing calendar. Some weeks I posted twice, other times once in three weeks. Substance drives conversions, and not consistency for consistency's sake. Then I'd extract the best highlights and convert them into social media formats: screenshots of key insights, and visual teasers that made people curious. Then I did something most people don't do: I'd publish my full post on Substack but future-date it 24+ hours after my social media post. This created a subscription trigger that converted casual scrollers into committed subscribers. I'd post my content on Twitter or LinkedIn, drop the link to my future-dated Substack post in the first comment, and wait. When users clicked through, they couldn't access the article yet. Substack prompted them to subscribe to be notified when it went live in 24+ hours. This FOMO effect generated conversion rates that you normally don't get with standard linking. Even though the article was often free, Substack's built-in upsell during the subscription flow naturally captured solid paid conversions. I also learned that platform selection matters for different goals: • X drove high volume but low willingness to pay, so I used it for building my free subscriber base • LinkedIn brought highly targeted audiences with much higher willingness to pay, so I prioritized it for driving paid subscriptions Then I accelerated my growth through collaboration. Cross-promotion with other influencers (like Deedy Das), amplified my reach through network effects exponentially. I identified complementary creators in my space (with similar audience sizes) and coordinated strategic audience sharing. This strategy inverts the typical Substack approach. Instead of building on Substack and hoping for discovery, you leverage the algo on existing social platforms and use future-dating plus FOMO to convert at exceptionally high rates. Which strategy has worked best for your audience growth? Drop your thoughts below.

    The future-dating trick is clever. Never thought about using Substack's "notify me" as a conversion mechanism.

    Might test it on my next piece. Just started Substack and about the write a first article in next a few days.
  strategy: "Express genuine interest in trying the tactic"
```

## Notes

- Future-dating posts 24+ hours after social creates FOMO-driven subscription
- Substack's notify prompt becomes conversion trigger
- LinkedIn for paid subs, X for free volume
- Cross-promotion with similar-sized creators for network effects
