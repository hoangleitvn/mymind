## Original Post

**Title:** SaaS is dying? Now you can just build everything

Mads challenges the "SaaS is dying" narrative by sharing his experience building Hurley (a user research agent). Despite coding with Claude daily, he maintains 10+ paid SaaS subscriptions.

Key argument: Building tools yourself with AI is possible, but not always practical. He pays a 30-40% premium for products that work reliably because "That's not my job. My job is building Hurley."

Why he buys rather than builds:
- Maintenance overhead (bugs, updates, model changes)
- Code review and planning requirements
- Outsourcing allows delegating operational concerns

Notable quote: "I'm happy to pay a 30-40% markup on tokens for a product that just works. That someone else obsesses over, so I can obsess over mine."

Community consensus: The question isn't "can I build this?" but "should I?" Maintenance burden makes purchasing preferable for non-core functions.

    General agreement that the question is "should I" not "can I" - maintenance burden and focus-stealing make purchasing preferable for non-core functions.

  status: "posted"
  strategy: "add-depth"

This is the right frame: "should I" over "can I."

The hidden trap I see teams fall into: they build internal tools with AI because it feels fast, then six months later they're maintaining three half-working integrations instead of one product that actually does the job.

AI makes building cheap. It doesn't make maintaining cheap. That's where the 30-40% premium earns itself back.
```

## Notes

- Mads is founder of Hurley (user research agent)
- Codes with Claude daily, still pays for 10+ SaaS tools
- Aligns with our "build vs buy" and "foundation-first" themes
- Good potential connection for AI tooling discussions
