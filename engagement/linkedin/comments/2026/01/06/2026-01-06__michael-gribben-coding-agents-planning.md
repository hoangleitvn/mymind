## Original Post

I think people are getting overwhelmed by coding agent hype.

Michael argues that rapid LLM advancement makes complex setups obsolete quickly. He shares 5 practical recommendations:

1. **Retry coding agents** - "your priors are likely out-of-date and deserve a refresh"

2. **Use latest models with thinking enabled** - Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2 Codex, and Gemini 3 Flash offer substantial improvements over older versions

3. **Plan before coding** - Agents work better when instructed to document task understanding first, forcing clarification questions

4. **Enable automated verification** - Use tools like Playwright for UI testing and automated API validation rather than manual testing

5. **Provide context on standards** - Share organizational best practices, architectural patterns, and playbooks through AGENTS.md files, Claude skills, or MCP servers

    The "plan before coding" point (rec #3) resonates. Been experimenting with this myself.

    Curious about your actual workflow here: Are you using Claude's built-in plan mode, asking the agent to write a spec first, or something else entirely?

    I've found that how you structure the planning step changes everything about agent output quality.
