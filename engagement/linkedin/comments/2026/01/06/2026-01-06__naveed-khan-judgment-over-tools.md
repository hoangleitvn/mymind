## Original Post

Naveed Khan reflects on 20+ years in IT spanning C/C++ development and leadership roles. He argues that true professional competence transcends memorizing frameworks or syntax perfection.

Key points:
- "Tools will keep changing but logic, judgment and experience never go out of date."
- Experienced professionals learned foundational concepts from documentation and developed logical debugging skills
- While newer engineers view modern tools as "magic," seasoned professionals understand underlying logic and systems architecture
- Technical skills fade, but judgment rooted in deep understanding remains relevant

This lands differently now with AI writing code.

AI handles the typing. AI can even handle some thinking. But judgment? That's still on us.

Knowing when to ship vs when to refine. When to build vs when to buy. When the AI suggestion is right vs when it's confidently wrong.

20 years of context can't be prompted.
  strategy: "amplify - Extends his judgment point to AI-assisted development reality"

## Notes

- Strong resonance with our "judgment over tools" perspective
- Extended his point to AI era without contradicting
- "20 years of context can't be prompted" ties back to his experience thesis
