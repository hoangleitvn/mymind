## Original Post

Nicole argues that AI-enabled generalists represent an emerging professional superpower. She cites:

- **Jack Clark (Anthropic co-founder):** "if you're good at managing humans, you'll be good at managing AI"
- **Jensen Huang:** Humans should focus on "poorly defined work" since AI handles routine tasks
- **Marc Andreessen:** Founders need mastery in 6-8 diverse skills

Key insight: Generalists thrive because they're comfortable with ill-defined problems lacking clear inputs, outputs, or established processes.

The “managing humans = managing AI” parallel is spot on.

Both require the same core skill: clarity. Clear context, clear constraints, clear expected outcomes. Vague direction produces vague results, whether you’re leading a team or prompting an LLM.

The real generalist advantage isn’t breadth alone. It’s judgment. Knowing enough to validate what comes back and to recognize what “good” actually looks like. Without that, confident-sounding output is indistinguishable from correct output.
  strategy: "add-depth - Amplifies Jack Clark quote, adds validation/clarity angle, ties to 'know what good looks like' principle"

## Notes

- Strong alignment with our clarity/context philosophy
- Jack Clark quote is the strongest hook to amplify
- Added "validation" angle (generalists need depth to verify AI output)
- Connects to "know what good looks like" principle
