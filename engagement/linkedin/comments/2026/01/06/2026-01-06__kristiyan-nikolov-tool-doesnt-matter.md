## Original Post

Kristiyan argues that the specific AI coding tool (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code) matters less than mastering fundamental software development practices:

1. **Search & Domain Knowledge** - Search skills translate directly to prompting
2. **Incremental Problem Solving** - Break complex tasks into testable steps
3. **Technical Understanding** - AI cannot compensate for knowledge gaps
4. **Consistent Architecture** - Establish clear patterns early
5. **Critical Review** - Read generated plans before implementation

Closing: Skipping these fundamentals inevitably produces substandard results.

This is the part most people skip: the tool amplifies what you already have.

Strong fundamentals + AI = faster delivery.
Weak fundamentals + AI = faster mess.

The "critical review" point is key. AI can be confidently wrong. If you can't recognize what "good" looks like, you can't tell the difference between useful output and plausible garbage.

The tool doesn't matter. The judgment does.
  strategy: "amplify - Reinforces thesis with crisp framing, adds 'faster mess' contrast, ties to 'know what good looks like' principle"

## Notes

- Very strong alignment with our philosophy
- "Faster mess" framing is memorable and shareable
- Echoes his conclusion without repeating
- Connects to "know what good looks like" principle
