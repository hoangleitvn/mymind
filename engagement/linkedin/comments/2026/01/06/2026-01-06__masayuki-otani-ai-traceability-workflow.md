Hoang Le Exactly, Hoang. If you can't trace an outcome back to a specific layer, state, or rule, you are effectively operating blind.

Predictability only exists when behaviour can be explained in architectural terms, not inferred from outputs. That traceability gap is where most serious AI workflows quietly fail, long before anyone asks whether the system is "safe".

Exactly. "It works" is not the same as "I understand why it works." The second one scales. The first one eventually breaks in ways you can't diagnose.

The real question is HOW do we build workflows that surface this traceability? Curious about your experience—how do you approach debugging root cause or tracking model behavior to figure out where to add rules or constraints?
  strategy: "Deepen conversation - agree and ask follow-up question to learn from their experience"
