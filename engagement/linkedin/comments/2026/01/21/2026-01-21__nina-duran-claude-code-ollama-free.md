## Post Summary

Nina shares a 5-step guide to run Claude Code with Ollama and open-source models at zero cost. The pitch: "The barrier to entry for agentic coding just dropped to zero."

## My Comment

I've been researching local LLM setups too. The trade-off is speed and quality. For complex multi-file changes, you notice the difference.

But as a fallback when you hit API limits? This is useful. You can also swap in Gemini models. Local LLM infrastructure is something enterprises will invest in. Having options keeps you productive when one provider is down or throttled.

## Analysis

**Mode:** Add Context
**Responded to:** Running Claude Code with local models for free
**Why:** Share practical trade-offs and position local LLM as fallback strategy, not replacement
**Source context:** Personal research on local LLM setups
