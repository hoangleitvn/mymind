## Post Summary

John argues AI creates chaos not because it's flawed, but because engineers expect it to manage global context and complexity. AI excels at well-defined local changes. The engineer's job is still managing complexity, defining architecture, and deciding task boundaries. AI handles implementation within those constraints.

## My Comment

Agreed. AI works well in a single codebase where everything is visible. But most real systems are distributed. Multiple services, integrations, external dependencies. Someone still needs to understand the end-to-end picture.

AI won't replace engineers. It might replace those who skip straight to vibe coding and ignore foundations, architecture, how to connect the dots. Humans create the strategy, plan, and coordinate with AI. Then review, judge, and own the output.

For me, AI cuts time on experiments and exploration. I can validate ideas faster and automate workflows that used to take hours. But I'm still the one deciding what to build and why.

## Analysis

**Mode:** Add Context
**Responded to:** "You understand the system, define the architecture, and decide what 'local' means for each task"
**Relevance:** Extends John's point about local vs global context to multi-system reality
**Word count:** 73
