## Original Post

Your team doesn't have an AI problem. They have a behaviour problem. 85% of AI initiatives fail. Not because ChatGPT doesn't work. Not because your team is lazy. And not because the tech is "overhyped." They fail because of human friction. McKinsey found the average enterprise loses $2.3M per failed digital initiative. Why? I spent 20 years leading 700+ behaviour change projects for the UN and White Rice Impact. I saw the same pattern in rural clinics that I now see in Fortune 500 boardrooms: Knowledge ≠ Action. People know they should use the tools. They just... don't.

Here is the actual breakdown of why your AI adoption is stalled:
- The Habit Gap: Old habits feel safer (and easier) than new tools.
- The Visibility Gap: Nobody is watching whether they actually use it.
- The Training Gap: You taught them "Features" (buttons), not "Workflows" (outcomes).
- The Social Gap: There is no proof that "people like me" are winning with this.

The Fix isn't "More Training." (You can't train away fear). The Fix is Behaviour Design.

I've seen teams struggle with AI mostly due to tech limitations and lack of proper integration, not just behavior issues. In my experience, a lot of failures happen because the technology isn't mature enough or it doesn't fit well with existing systems.

AI adoption stalls because habits beat tools, every time. Most teams aren't resisting AI, they're protecting what feels safe and familiar. Until leaders design the environment, workflows, and social proof, "training" just becomes another slide deck that loses to Monday morning.

Love this take. Stop prompting, start designing your workflow. Improve your skills. Then tools will follow.

Don't chase the models war. You'll fall behind.

This is what I believe.

## Notes

- Behavior change expert with UN and consulting background
- 11K+ followers, good engagement on posts
- His "Knowledge ≠ Action" framing is strong
- Four gaps framework is useful but missing psychological safety
- Could connect to our AI adoption content
