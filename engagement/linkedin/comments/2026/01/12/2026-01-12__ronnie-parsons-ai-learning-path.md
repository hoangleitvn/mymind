## Original Post

Most AI learning paths are backwards. Here's how I would start instead... Don't start with machine learning fundamentals. Neural networks. Math. That's like learning how an engine works before you've even driven a car. Here's the path that actually makes sense for founders: 1. Learn to Use (Generative AI → Prompt Engineering) Start with Claude, Gemini, Midjourney. Get comfortable. Then figure out how to get better outputs. These are power user skills, and they compound. 2. Learn to Leverage (Context & Memory → AI Agents) Once you're prompting well, the question becomes: "How do I make this work with my data? My business?" RAG, embeddings, context windows.. this is where AI stops being a distraction and starts being useful. Then agents: systems that act independently. This is where leverage multiplies. 3. Learn to Build (AI-Native Dev → Infrastructure) Now you're ready to create. Claude Code, APIs. Vibe-coding. Actual implementation. As you build, you hit practical limits. Latency. Rate limits. Costs. Infrastructure knowledge becomes essential. 4. Learn to Sustain (AI Safety → Machine Learning) With systems running, you need guardrails. Hallucinations matter when AI touches customers. Machine learning comes last. Why? Because founders use ML outputs but rarely build ML models. Nice to know, not day-one mission critical.

Love this framework! But I gotta say - after working with founders on AI compliance, I've seen this exact learning path create some nasty surprises when regulations hit... You're vibe-coding with Claude, building cool agents, feeling like a genius... then suddenly your legal team says "We can't launch this - where's the impact assessment?"

Solid visual summary. My hot take is that 'agents' are not the holy grail. They have been presupposed as one due to speculation. The real angle is use-case clarity.

The ones getting real traction aren't waiting to understand transformers before they start. They're using AI to solve actual business problems and learning the deeper mechanics only when they hit real constraints.

This mirrors what we tell founders: you don't need to hire AI/ML engineers for most AI projects.

You need people who can use AI outputs and know enough to validate them. The ML knowledge comes last, if ever. Most teams never need it.

## Notes

- Well-known AI educator with 11K+ followers
- Post has good engagement (100 reactions, 10 comments)
- Nouman's compliance comment is valuable counterpoint
- Connects to our vibe coding / AI bubble content
- His use of "vibe-coding" term is interesting - mainstream adoption of the concept
