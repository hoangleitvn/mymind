## Original Post

Handoff-ready product: docs, access, and runbooks. If your developer leaves tomorrow, can someone take over? Ensure you have: Repo access, environment variables, and infra credentials in a vault. README with setup steps and one-click seed data. Runbook for deploy, rollback, and common incidents. Contact map: vendors, domains, SSL, billing owners. Architecture sketch and data model diagram (even rough). Continuity is a feature. Build it before you need it.

Thanks for bringing this up, continuity as a first-class feature is an important point that's often overlooked. Clear ownership boundaries and known technical debt hotspots are also invaluable... One critical item I would like to add, is the handoff kit is decision context: brief notes on why key architectural and product decisions were made.

"Continuity is a feature" - this framing is spot on.

The teams that skip this aren't lazy. They're optimizing for speed now at the cost of speed later. Foundation work feels slow until someone leaves and you realize how much knowledge walked out the door.

I think about foundations in 5 categories: Speed, Continuity, Quality, Decision, Recovery. Most teams have some. The gaps show up as slow onboarding, quality issues, or long incident times.

This is exactly why I started writing about foundations. Everyone ships fast. Few build to last.

## Notes

- Tech advisor/startup focus
- Smaller following (1.7K) but relevant topic
- Aligns with BTL foundation-first philosophy
- Ashish's comment about decision context is a good addition
