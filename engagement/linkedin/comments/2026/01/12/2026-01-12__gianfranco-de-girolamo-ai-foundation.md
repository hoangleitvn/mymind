  key_points:
    - AI doesn't fix broken processes - it amplifies them
    - Before implementing AI, understand your current workflow
    - AI is an accelerant - works for or against you

## Original Post

A firm consulted with me to help with AI implementation. First thing I saw: their intake process was chaos. No system. No follow-up. Leads dying everywhere. They wanted AI to fix it. 𝗔𝗜 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗳𝗶𝘅 𝗯𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻. 𝗜𝘁 𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝘁. If your process is broken, AI makes it break faster. If your communication is unclear, AI scales the confusion. If your systems are chaos, AI creates chaos at machine speed. Here's what most firms miss: Before you implement AI, you need to know what you're implementing it INTO. What's the current workflow? Where are the bottlenecks? What does success look like? Who owns the outcome? AI is an accelerant. Pour it on a good system, you get exponential results. Pour it on a bad system, you get exponential problems. Fix the foundation first. Then add the AI. What's broken that you're hoping AI will magically solve? #ai #lawfirm #systems #legaltech

I spent the day watching You Tube videos on intake in between laundry. Either a sign of illness or …(I can't think of a good alternative here).

We've landed on a simple sequence: workflow first, skills second, tools follow.

Most teams reverse it. They pick the tool, then wonder why adoption fails. The foundation work you're describing is exactly that first step most skip.
  strategy: "Add Context - Reinforce his thesis with our workflow-first framework"

## Notes

- Strong alignment with our foundation-first positioning
- His audience is law firms, but the principle applies universally
- Could be good connection for cross-industry perspective on AI implementation
- Monitor for reply - potential relationship opportunity
