## Original Post

322 comments. 241 reactions. I wasn't expecting that response. Last Thursday I ran a workshop on building Claude agents without code. 100 seats filled in under 4 hours. The replay access requests are still coming in. But, here's what surprised me most. The workshop wasn't about AI tools or productivity hacks. It was about architectural thinking, how to design systems that actually solve business problems instead of creating more complexity. We built a content-repurposing agent live. Took one piece of long-form content and turned it into tweets, LinkedIn posts, email sequences. All while maintaining voice and style. The framework we used: → Instructions: Who your agent is and how it behaves → Memory: Context it maintains across conversations → Knowledge: Documents and files it references → Skills: Reusable capabilities that work anywhere Four layers. No code. Just clear thinking about what problem you're actually solving. The replay includes the full 60-minute workshop, the framework, and the agent we built together. If you want access to the workshop replay: 1. Connect with me 2. Like the post 3. Comment "REPLAY" I'll send you the link via DM. Happy building.

    The response to your workshop is validating a massive shift in the market: we are finally moving past the era of the "magic prompt." For a long time, people treated AI as a slot machine: pull the handle (prompt) and hope for a jackpot. But as you note, the real value isn't in the syntax but in the Architecture. I've found that the rise of Agentic workflows is the catalyst for this.

    Building something similar. Would love the REPLAY to see your framework in action.

## Notes

- High engagement post (493 reactions, 322 comments)
- Most comments are just "REPLAY" - ours stands out by showing context
- His framework (Instructions, Memory, Knowledge, Skills) aligns with our agent work
- Gated content play - good lead gen tactic
- Already engaged with him on another post today + sent connection request
