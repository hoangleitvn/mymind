## Original Post

AI - Not a silver bullet for amplifying release speeds exponentially Off late, I've been hearing a lot about how AI can be used to ship software at breakneck speeds. In many established organisations, Engineering teams are being pushed to adopt AI coding tools to write code, in the hopes that it will help with shipping products/features quickly. For someone from a product background like me, while I understand why businesses are pushing for increased productivity with AI, I don't think that Claude Codes of the world possess the capabilities yet to solely build scalable, secure and valuable products which are stable. Instead, Engineering teams need to look at other areas of software development where AI can help automate repetitive tasks, which thereby provides a boost to productivity leading to faster release cycles. Possible areas where I think Engineering teams could benefit from using AI: 1. To get a better understanding of requirements to be met 2. As a buddy/mentor for devs to brainstorm their ideas when they hit a roadblock 3. For code reviews 4. For writing unit tests 5. Intelligent automation for the entire QA cycle Would love to understand from Engineering leaders on how they are looking at the myth of AI coding tools = Faster release cycles.

Totally agree. The real acceleration comes not just from coding speed, but optimizing the entire development lifecycle. AI is a powerful enhancer, but the surrounding processes need to adapt too.

The biggest gains we've seen aren't in code generation. They're in reducing the "work about work": drafting specs, writing test cases, reviewing PRs for obvious issues.

Code writing was never the bottleneck. Understanding what to build and validating it works? That's where AI helps most.

## Notes

- Product background person asking engineering leaders for input
- His list of 5 areas mostly aligns with our experience
- Good opportunity to share practical perspective
- Relatively small following (1.1K) but engaged on relevant topic
