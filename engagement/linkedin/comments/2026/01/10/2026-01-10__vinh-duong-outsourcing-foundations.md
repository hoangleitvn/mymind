## Original Post

Most companies skip fit assessment to move fast into outsourcing. Then the scope gaps show up. Requirements keep changing. Delivery friction compounds. What looked like faster capacity becomes expensive archaeology work across time zones. Same pattern in engineering. Hoang Le just launched Issue #1 of Builds That Last with a framework that applies to both: Speed without foundation creates the illusion of progress. Then reality catches up. His AI paradox: Tools accelerate code generation 10x but increase verification burden 30-40%. Speed amplifies what you already have, foundations or debt. In outsourcing: → Clear scope before engagement → Fit assessment before vendor selection → Foundation first, velocity second The companies that succeed with outsourcing? They treat it as a strategic decision, not a hiring shortcut. Read Hoang's full piece on why foundation comes before speed: https://lnkd.in/gzmAuDjQ

Thanks for sharing this Vinh. The outsourcing parallel nails it.

We ship fast. But foundation-first is intentional. Helping clients move fast and stay sustainable. Speed without clarity just creates expensive cleanup later.

## Notes

- Vinh is INNOMIZE team member sharing BTL article
- Good parallel between outsourcing and engineering foundations
- Reinforces BTL positioning through real-world outsourcing lens
- Consider thanking Vinh privately for the share
