## Original Post

Unpopular opinion from an AI guy: AI will never build authentic trust or rapport because machines are incapable of intent, empathy and accountability. AI can only simulate these qualities effectively.

    Trust in systems depends on predictability, bounded behaviour, auditability,
    and enforceable accountability—not empathy. Accountability belongs with system
    owners and operators through governance structures, not with AI models themselves.

    Teams misunderstand trust dynamics. Rather than AI creating trust, it should
    focus on preventing trust violations through reliability, coverage, and clear ownership.

You're right that AI lacks intent and empathy. But, trust isn't about feeling understood. It's about predictability.

When I check a weather app, I don't need it to care about my picnic. I need it to be accurate 90% of the time. Same with AI. The question isn't "does it feel?" It's "does it do what it says consistently?"

And I agreed with Dr Masayuki Otani: accountability belongs to system owners, not the model.
  strategy: "Reframe with systems thinking - acknowledge valid point while offering alternative perspective"

## Notes

- Brad is an AI professional, posting thought-provoking takes
- Thread already has quality pushback from Dr. Otani and Carson Platts
- My comment builds on existing thread while adding concrete example (weather app)
- Topic aligns with foundation-first thinking (systems reliability over emotional appeal)
