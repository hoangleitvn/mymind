## Original Post

Due to popular demand here is my Coding Agent Stack. I've used them all. Claude Code has one superpower none of the others match: the agentic loop actually works. It reads, plans, executes, hits a wall, re-plans, and keeps going without me babysitting. The others require constant course correction. CC just figures it out and builds reliable code.

My rankings (criteria: how often I use):
1. Claude Code: workhorse
2. Antigravity: in-line PRD editing and multi-agent orchestration via point-and-click
3. Zenflow & Maestro (tied) — parallel agents grinding on large codebases. Token burn is real.
4. Codex & Cursor — only when curiosity strikes for comparison run

My Claude Code Setup - Tier 1 Daily Drivers:
1. Claude Superpowers - /superpower:brainstorm and /superpower:debug
2. Episodic Memory - records every CC conversation across instances
3. Context7 MCP - pulls current documentation, no more hallucinated APIs

What I haven't solved yet:
- True blackbox QA testing
- Auto detecting when CC is stuck and thrashing

Tier 2 — Situational:
- SuperClaude — /sc:document, /sc:explain, /sc:cleanup
- Firecrawl — web scraping and search
- Browserbase — workflow automation with real browser sessions
- Playwright — UI testing
- Typescript-lsp — better type inference for TS
- Hookify — custom hooks, YOLO mode with rm -rf and git push --force confirmation

Signal I've found: explaining the same thing three times means the context is degraded, not confused.

Fresh context beats more explanation.
  strategy: "Add Context - respond to his explicit ask about thrashing detection with practical insight"

## Notes

- Caleb has 18K+ followers, influential in AI/security space
- Post shares his full Claude Code stack - practical, not theoretical
- He explicitly asks for solutions to unsolved problems (engagement invitation)
- His plugin tiering aligns with my experience (most don't survive)
- Good potential connection for Claude Code practitioner network
