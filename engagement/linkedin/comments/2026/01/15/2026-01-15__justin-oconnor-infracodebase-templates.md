## Original Post

Today, we are launching Infracodebase Templates! Public Workspaces built by the community for the community so that you can get started fast. Templates are #code + #cloud #diagram, driven by human intent and created by #agents. To get started, simply fork the Workspace into your Enterprise and keep working. Thank you to all of those who have already started building. For those that haven't, we can't wait to see what you do with Templates at https://lnkd.in/egqRDDyJ. To stay up to date, follow us on Onward Platforms!

Sharing this with my DevOps team. The "fork and keep working" model for IaC templates is what most teams need. Copy-paste Terraform without guardrails is how technical debt compounds. Community templates with agent-enforced patterns change that.
  strategy: "Amplify - Signal boost the community templates model, connect to real pain point (copy-paste Terraform), show why it matters"

Love this perspective, and thank you for sharing it with your team.

That's exactly the problem we're trying to solve. Most teams don't need another snippet. They need a solid starting point they can fork, keep working from, and evolve without drifting into copy-paste debt. Guardrails matter, but they should come from patterns and intent, not rigid rules.

Community templates, paired with agents that help reinforce those patterns over time, feel like a more natural way to scale good infrastructure practices. Really appreciate the feedback and the signal that this resonates.

"Solid starting point" is the key distinction. Complete templates are rigid. Solid templates let teams fork and add their own pieces without touching the original design. That's how patterns scale without becoming constraints.
```

## Notes

- Explored Infracodebase in December 2025 (captured in moments/2025-12/2025-12-15-172000__infracodebase-iac-ai-agents.md)
- Key insight: deterministic agents matter for IaC - you don't want AI hallucinating your infrastructure
- Aligns with my DevSecOps and cloud architecture expertise
- Could be valuable connection for IaC content
