## Original Post

I grow on LinkedIn in 60 minutes a day. Here's the exact hour. • Commenting (20–30 min): 10–15 new creators 5–10 in my network to stay top‑of‑mind replying to every comment of my post. • DMs (15–20 min): Greet new connections, clear inbox, and message 2 profile visitors (1 new, 1 older). • Profile + Posting (10–15 min): Check profile views and connect/follow, publish my post, and repost in 6–8 hours. Copy it if you want a structured hour. How much time do you spend on LinkedIn?

I spend 2 hours per day, at least. And I'm not afraid to admit it. All hours are "business building" activities.

Posting alone takes me 30-45 minutes, depending on the visual/topic. However, I think I should spend more time doing 1 and 2 in your list, and less on 3 :)

On the days when I use it, oftentime 2-3 hours. But I do have days when I don't use it at all. It does not work for me mentally to use it every single day. I really need to take breaks from Social Media apps.

## Our Engagement

  type: "comment"

  sentiment: "question"

Curious about the 10-15 new creators part. Do you stick to your industry or go broader? I find the best conversations come from adjacent fields, but it takes more effort to find them.
  strategy: "Ask - genuine question about discovery strategy for commenting"

## Notes

- Tactical LinkedIn growth content, not strongly aligned with my core themes
- First engagement with Alina
- Light engagement, genuine question about creator discovery
- Not a high-priority relationship target but relevant to understand LinkedIn growth tactics
