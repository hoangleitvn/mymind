## Original Post

Daniel argues the gap between idea-holders and builders isn't technical skills, funding, or time constraints, but rather a mental limitation — the belief that one must understand everything before starting. Modern tools have lowered entry barriers significantly. Success requires accepting that first versions will be imperfect and messy. The competitive advantage belongs to those comfortable with discomfort and willing to iterate.

Key question posed: What truly holds you back — skills or something psychological?

## Our Engagement

```yaml
- id: 1736956800000
  type: "comment"
  status: "posted"
  sentiment: "personal"
  content: |
Feel this daily. The more I know about what can go wrong, the harder it is to start.

Curious — do you think this mindset is teachable, or does it require a forcing function?
  strategy: "Personal vulnerability + genuine question to invite dialogue"
