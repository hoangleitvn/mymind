## Original Post

AI coding has momentum but I know my team still can't use it. We see AI-first coding and people building tools with AI. We are all excited, but we are also stuck. Because we don't have good coding experience. These AI-first coding tools… They assume the user is experienced with code. But most teams? They're marketers, PMs, and operators, not devs. Their AI development curiosity gets crushed by friction and fear. That's where the shift happens: AI coding tools e.g. Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf:: → Best for developers inside existing codebases → Start with repos and installs → Work through commands → Hosting and deployment are extra → Outcome for non-devs: curiosity → frustration Prompt based tool Replit: → Opens instantly in your browser → Start with a plain-language prompt → Watch AI agent build live, in real time → One-click to publish your app with a link → Outcome: curiosity → shippable product Takeaway: AI coding assistants + Replit accelerates developers. Replit alone gives non-developers superpowers. AI coding is a spark. Replit turns that spark into a working product without any manual technical work. Not just for coders. For anyone ready to build. #replitpartner

The friction isn't the tool. It's knowing what to build and what "working" means.

Replit removes setup friction. That's real. But the hard part is still there: validation, edge cases, what happens when users do unexpected things.

Shipped fast and shipped right are different problems.
  strategy: "Push Back - respectfully challenge the 'no technical work needed' framing while acknowledging the valid point about setup friction"

## Notes

- Sponsored content (#replitpartner), so comments are mostly supportive
- The "no manual technical work" claim is oversimplified
- Valid point: setup friction is real for non-devs
- Missing: the skills gap doesn't disappear with easier tools
- Not a high-priority relationship (marketing influencer, sponsored content)
- Comment adds nuance without attacking the sponsorship
