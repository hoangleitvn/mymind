## Original Post

Most people are collecting AI tools. Very few are building AI capability. That's the difference this graphic is really pointing to. These aren't trends. They're the skills that decide whether AI stays a side experiment or becomes part of how work actually gets done in 2026. Here's how leaders should actually use this list. If you're early in AI Start with prompting, workflow automation, and agents. Not to master them. But to understand how AI thinks, where it breaks, and what it can handle without supervision. If you're building real systems Spend time on RAG, customization, and evaluation. This is where many AI initiatives fail quietly. Not because the model is bad, but because answers can't be trusted, costs drift, and no one knows why. If you're thinking at enterprise level You can't ignore tool stacking. This isn't about productivity hacks. It's about designing end-to-end operating models where AI fits into real workflows with ownership, handoffs, and accountability. One mistake I see often Trying to learn all nine. The real skill isn't breadth. It's knowing which layer to invest in based on the problem you're solving. A better question than "Which AI tool should I learn next?" Ask this instead. "What part of my work breaks first when AI is introduced?" That answer tells you which skill actually matters. Save this. Revisit it in six months. If your focus hasn't shifted, you're probably not going deep enough. Repost to help others focus where it actually counts.

The way you frame capability over collecting gadgets rings true, Gabriel. In events operations we see the same pattern: shiny tech gets attention, but it's the systems and processes behind the scenes that determine whether innovation actually delivers.

most companies are still collecting tools instead of building capability. the real work is in the 2-3 months of daily tweaking after you deploy - that's where you learn what actually works vs what's just hype.

This is the clearest separation I've seen between using AI and building with AI. Most people are still at the toy stage.

This hits the real issue. Tools are easy to collect, capability takes intent, reps, and ownership. The question about where work breaks is the one most teams avoid, and it's the one that actually moves things forward.

Same pattern in my team. We stopped building prompt libraries last year. 1000 prompts don't teach you when to use which.

Built a skill framework instead: problem framing, evaluation, correction. The prompts became outputs, not inputs.

Tools you can download. Capability you have to build.

## Notes

- Third engagement with Gabriel (previous: 2026 predictions, data quality foundations)
- Aligns with my "5 skills" content and "foundation first" positioning
- His "which layer to invest in" matches my "skills over prompts" thinking
- Enterprise AI transformation audience overlaps with my tech leader positioning
