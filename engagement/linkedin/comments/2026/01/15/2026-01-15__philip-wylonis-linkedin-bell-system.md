## Original Post

I use LinkedIn every day. But not like you. I haven't scrolled my LinkedIn feed in months. Instead I built a system to protect my focus...

→ I only engage with people who consistently make me think.
→ I only comment when I can genuinely contribute.
→ I only give my attention where it's earned.

And it all starts with one thing: The 🔔 bell.

Here's how I use it:
🔔 Turn all notifications on for 10 people
🙅 If one post doesn't resonate, unfollow immediately
🎯 Set insanely high standards for who earns your attention

Sometimes I like to follow people with opposite beliefs as me... I can look for my own potential Blindspots...

Posting about not scrolling LinkedIn... on LinkedIn. The algorithm thanks you for the content while you ignore its feed.
