# Bobby Lough - Software Engineering Beyond Code

## Post Summary

**Author:** Bobby Lough
**Followers:** 1,561
**Topic:** Software engineering is about systems, context, and people - not just typing code

**Key points:**
- Knowledge lives in people, not repos and wiki pages
- AI accelerates code writing, but judgment and experience remain essential
- Organizations need diverse experience levels learning from each other
- We must keep training the next generation even as tools change

**Quote:** "That knowledge doesn't live in repos and wiki pages, it lives in people."

## My Comment

```
"Knowing why things are the way they are."

This is what AI accelerates past.

Code generates in seconds. But understanding why that architecture was chosen, why that workaround exists - that context lives in conversations, not prompts.

The faster we write code, the more important it becomes to understand the system first.

This is why I started Builds That Last. Foundations don't change when tools do.

Training the next generation matters more now, not less.
```

## Why This Resonates

- Aligns with Foundation-First Engineering philosophy
- Supports Builder Mindset theme
- Natural opportunity to mention BTL mission
- Reinforces "foundations over frameworks" message
