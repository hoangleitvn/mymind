# Vatsal Sanghvi - Specialists vs Generalists

## Post Summary

**Author:** Vatsal Sanghvi
**Followers:** 16,000+
**Topic:** The professional landscape is polarizing - middle-tier professionals face obsolescence

**Key argument:** Markets reward two archetypes:
1. Super specialists (PhD-level depth, irreplaceable)
2. Hyper generalists (execute thought → prototype → product → revenue)

**Quote:** "Go deep enough that you become the reference point. Or go wide enough that you become the person who ships."

## My Comment

```
This hit home.

The industry celebrates specialists. But generalists ship.

15 years, 50+ systems. Not a great architect. Not a great cloud engineer. Not great at React, Node, or DevOps.

But I can take an idea from thought → prototype → production → users.

The middle isn't squeezed because they lack skill. They lack the ability to execute end-to-end.

Deep enough to be dangerous. Wide enough to ship.
```

## Why This Resonates

- Directly aligns with my "Specialists celebrate, generalists ship" insight
- Validates the Builder Mindset theme for INNOMIZE YEP
- Personal experience: shipped 50+ systems without being expert in any single thing

## Connection Potential

- First engagement with Vatsal
- Aligned perspective on generalist builders
- Potential follow-up: share my LinkedIn post on this topic when published
