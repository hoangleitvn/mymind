## Original Post

I can't count the amount of times I've been stuck on a frustrating coding problem for hours... Only to come back and fix it in minutes the next day. Sometimes sleep is the best debugger ✌️

So true. I've learned to just close the laptop when I hit that wall. The number of times I've spent 3 hours debugging something, gave up, then solved it in 10 minutes the next morning is ridiculous. Fresh eyes > brute force every time.

Often the hardest bugs need distance, not more staring at code.

Same, I've solved some of the hardest challenges while taking the morning shower on top of a good nights sleep 💯

The hardest part is convincing yourself to actually stop.

Closing the laptop when you're stuck feels like giving up. But it's the opposite. Brute force debugging past the "stuck" point usually digs you deeper into the wrong mental model.

Sleep resets the assumptions.
