## Original Post

If your value is "I can code" — you're in trouble. If your value is "I can figure out what to build and why" — you're more valuable than ever. AI writes code. It doesn't know what's worth building. That's the job now.

But this actually hasn't changed at all. It's always been more about "why are you writing the code?" AI just made it more apparent.

I'll add that knowing what _not_ to code has also gone up in value.

The teams struggling with AI tools are the ones who skipped foundations. They chase 10x productivity, trust outputs blindly. The skill that matters now is knowing when the AI is confidently wrong.
  strategy: "Add Context - extends post with observation from experience about foundation-first approach and validation skills"

## Notes

- Post aligns with our AI coding lessons content (2026-01-14 published post)
- Matthew is in SaaS space, smaller following (506) but engaged audience
- Good topic overlap with BTL themes on foundations and judgment
