## Original Post

I've consulted with a lot of companies over the past few years, and there's one question that always comes up - "Should we go with AWS or Azure?" And every time, I ask a simple follow‑up: "Why?" Most of the time… they don't actually know. They assume those are the only two options for storing and using their data because that's what everyone else uses. Or that they want to scale in the future and think they have to have it. Depending on the situation and their business I may say neither. What about a CRM? CRMs still exist and for a ton of startups/small companies, a CRM can be more cost‑effective, easier to manage, and immediately useful compared to spinning up cloud infrastructure you don't actually need yet! Reasons for using a CRM: 1. Lower cost You're not paying for compute, storage, networking, and engineering time just to get started (for the most part) 2. Built‑in workflows Sales, marketing, support, onboarding are ready to go out of the box. 3. Faster setup You can be operational in hours with built-in infrastructure and pipelines. 4. Easier integrations Most CRMs plug directly into tools you're already using. 5. Scales with you You can always move to AWS/Azure later when you actually need custom infrastructure. Cloud platforms are powerful no question, but for many early‑stage teams, a CRM isn't just "good enough" - it can often be the better option.

"Scaling" is the most expensive word in a founder's vocabulary. Everyone wants to build for 10 million users on Day 1, but they don't have 10 customers yet.

This resonates a lot. 👏 "Why?" is the most important (and most overlooked) part of the AWS vs Azure debate. Too many teams go with hyper-scalers because it sounds like the "grown-up" choice, not because it's the right one now at the moment.

The "Why?" question applies to existing cloud users too. After years doing AWS audits, the pattern is the same: teams built for 10M users before they had 100. Now they're paying 30-50% more than needed just to maintain infrastructure nobody uses yet.

Right-size the decision first. The tools can always grow with you.
