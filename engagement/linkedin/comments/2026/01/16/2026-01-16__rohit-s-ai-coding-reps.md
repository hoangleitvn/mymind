## Original Post

The head of Claude Code recently said he hasn't written code by hand in 30 days. But I think one thing people miss: he's an expert. He knows what good code looks like. AI is a multiplier, not a substitute and does exactly what you prompt it to do. But prompting it well? That requires the same deep understanding you'd need to write the code yourself. If you're early in your career: don't skip the reps. Read code. Write code. Understand why things work. That's what makes AI actually useful later. Technical debt is real, and it compounds.

Agreed. He's constantly directing, rejecting, reviewing, re-routing AI to write code. He's constantly involved. Without him, those AI agents would produce NOTHING of value. Ever. AI is doing the typing. And you aren't replacing him in any sense.

I've seen quite a lot of horror stories lately of non-technical people deploying vibe-coded applications and then having all of their user data or API keys easily stolen by hackers. Cybersecurity is something you MUST have ownership for.

Exactly. This only works after you have taste. Experts can stop typing because they can smell bad code instantly. Juniors cannot. AI does not teach judgment. It amplifies whatever judgment you already have. If you skip the reps, AI just helps you ship debt faster. If you do the reps, AI becomes a serious force multiplier. Foundations first. Shortcuts later.

To use AI really effectively, one thing that really works for me is to break large work into smaller parts and provide detailed prompts to write those small parts really well with the help of AI. For dividing large work into small parts, one would need to understand the art of writing production-grade code that can scale really well.

The hardest part is figuring out when juniors are ready to lean on AI more. Too early and they never build the instincts. Too late and they're frustrated watching seniors move faster.

Have you found a good signal for when someone's "done enough reps"?
  strategy: "Ask - genuine question about the 'don't skip the reps' advice, invites conversation"

## Notes

- Strong post that aligns with our AI coding content
- Rohit is referencing Boris Cherny (Claude Code head) - same person we reference in our published post
- Good opportunity to reinforce our "foundation first" positioning
- Comment section has quality engagement - engineers who understand the nuance
