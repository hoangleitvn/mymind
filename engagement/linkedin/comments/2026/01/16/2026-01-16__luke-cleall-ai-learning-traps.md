## Original Post

I wasted 6 months learning AI the wrong way. Watched every tutorial. Studied every workflow. Followed every guru. "Build this 47-step automation!" "This workflow saves 200 hours a month!" "Here's my $10K/month AI system!" I saved the videos. Took notes. Felt like I was making progress. I wasn't. I was just procrastinating with a purpose. 6 months of learning. Zero value provided. And here's why it's so easy to get stuck there: Your brain doesn't want you to take risks. It wants you to stay safe. Watching tutorials feels productive. Building something that might fail? That's uncomfortable. So we keep learning. Keep preparing. Keep waiting until we're "ready." We never are. When I finally started building, I made the opposite mistake. Built workflows that looked impressive. Multiple modules. Clever logic. Some never got used. They solved problems nobody actually had. I was copying what looked good on YouTube instead of solving what was painful in real life. 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗽 𝟭: Learning from content designed to impress, not help. 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗽 𝟮: Building solutions before understanding pain points. Both feel safe. Neither move the needle. The gurus aren't lying. But they're optimising for views, not your results. Your business doesn't need a 47-step workflow. It needs the simple automations that move data, complete quotes, generate replies, etc. The only thing that changes anything? Actually starting. Messy. Imperfect. Probably broken the first time. That's how you learn. Not by watching someone else do it. Which traps have you fallen into?

This is uncomfortably accurate. I've definitely hidden behind "learning" when the real work was talking to users and shipping something that might fall over. Another trap I've fallen into is over-engineering the solution because it could scale, not because it needed to. The moment I stopped building what looked impressive and started fixing one real, annoying problem, everything changed. Progress got a lot less glamorous, but a lot more real.

First, come up with something you want to build. Something you want to accomplish. 'Learn AI' is so generic. You really getting out of bed to learn AI? TO DO WHAT?! Then, just do it. The tech is moving so fast, information is outdated insanely fast. Just go, do, create, enjoy it.

The second trap hits hard. I keep seeing teams build impressive AI workflows. Multiple modules. Clever logic. Never used.

They optimized for "look what I can do" instead of "what problem am I solving."

Starting ugly and iterating on real problems works. Starting impressive rarely does.
