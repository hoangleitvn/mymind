## Original Post

I haven't written a line of code manually in 6 months. Every commit. Every PR. Every feature. All built through AI agents. Here's what changed: → I stopped typing syntax, started describing intent → I review and guide instead of character-by-character coding → My velocity increased 3-5x on complex features → I spend more time on architecture, less on boilerplate This isn't about AI replacing developers. It's about working at a higher abstraction layer. After 20+ years of coding, I thought I'd resist. Instead, I went all-in. The result? I ship faster, think bigger, and the code quality is better than my manual work. Andrej Karpathy calls this the future of programming. Boris Cherny at Anthropic describes it as cutting-edge practice. I'm not special. I just stopped fighting the tools. If you're a senior engineer hesitating to adopt AI coding tools: You're not protecting your skills. You're limiting your impact. --- What's your experience with AI-native development? Are you still writing every line manually?

The abstraction layer framing is the key insight. After a year of heavy AI use, my takeaway: AI amplifies what you already know. The velocity gains are real, but they compound on existing mental models. Seniors who go all-in bring decades of pattern recognition. That context isn't optional.
  strategy: "Add Context - agree with core thesis while grounding in personal experience about foundation-first approach"

## Notes

- Post aligns with my published content on AI-assisted development
- Alex references Boris Cherny (Anthropic) and Karpathy - credible sources
- His "higher abstraction layer" framing matches my "foundation first" thesis
- Potential connection target - shares similar perspective on AI engineering
- Low engagement post (14 reactions) - good for early comment visibility
