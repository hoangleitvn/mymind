## Original Post

Introducing Mobile Apps by Replit Building mobile apps usually means learning a specialized stack, wrestling with Xcode/Android Studio, certificates, and submission workflows. That's a huge barrier for many. Today, we're removing it. Here's how you can go from idea to App Store in minutes: 1. Describe your idea in chat & get a React Native mobile app in minutes. 2. Scan a QR code to test your app on your phone. 3. Create an Apple Developer account. 4. Publish to the App Store directly from Replit Your mobile apps can be fully functional from day one. You can integrate: - Database - Auth - Integrations (OpenAI, Stripe, Twilio etc) & more This launch was made possible by our partnership with Expo. Support for Play Store coming soon.

I'd like to see an easier handoff from Replit to another IDE and back. In my experience, it has been very hard to edit the repo outside of replit and still effectively use replit; it breaks.

I tried building exactly this thing in october 2024 however I was not very impressed because the models were missing the certain nuances of app mobile design. The major benefit this gives is that as non app developer you can build a basic app in few minutes. I would like to try this one.

Curious about the handoff story. When someone builds the MVP here and needs to scale or customize beyond what the platform supports, what does that path look like? Does the generated React Native code work cleanly in a standalone dev environment?
  strategy: "Ask - genuine question about a practical concern (ecosystem lock-in) that Cody Menefee also raised, framed constructively"

## Notes

- High-engagement post from major platform (801 reactions)
- Lenny Rachitsky endorsement adds credibility signal
- Expo comment uses "vibe coding" terminology - connects to my content themes
- Cody's concern about IDE handoff is valid and aligns with my "foundation first" thinking
- This is a company page, not personal - different engagement dynamic
- Question comment adds value by building on existing discussion thread
