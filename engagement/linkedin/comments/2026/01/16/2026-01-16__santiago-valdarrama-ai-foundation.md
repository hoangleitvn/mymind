## Original Post

I was working with a team right before the holidays. I was helping them fix some AI-induced mess they created. To be honest, they didn't have an AI problem. Their issue was rushing to integrate Claude Code on an existing codebase with no tests, no CI/CD, and very poor documentation. It was also a very large codebase. This is one of those situations where I'm very cautious about Claude Code: you can't bring it into a large, complex codebase and expect it to just work. Many people think that agentic coding made engineering principles useless. It didn't. Good engineering practices didn't become less important because of AI. They actually became the difference between AI being a liability and a force multiplier. Without a good foundation, AI will just help you ship garbage faster. The companies that will continue crushing it with AI are those that already have solid engineering practices in place.

Exactly this. AI amplifies whatever foundation you already have, and if that foundation is shaky you're just scaling the mess. Learned this the hard way shipping 50+ apps - the teams that succeed with AI had their testing and docs dialed in before adding Claude to the mix.

Without documentation, the AI has no context for why decisions were made historically.

How do you think about solving such a problem. I'm a non dev now working on multiple small apps but each additional one gets bigger. I've learned some engineering principles from AI itself and then try to separate different jobs and workers. Seems like the best way is to only work on certain parts of the code base at a time?

Seen this pattern a few times now. The teams that struggle blame Claude Code. But the real issue is always what was already there: no tests to catch hallucinations, no docs for context, no CI to enforce standards.

The AI just made the existing problems visible faster.
  strategy: "Add Context - validate with experience, reframe from 'AI problem' to 'foundation problem'"
