## Original Post

I replaced myself with AI for a day.

I almost lost my company.

Here's what happened: 
Last Tuesday, I decided to run an experiment. 

Let AI handle everything - emails, Slack, CRM updates, lead research, follow-ups. Everything.

I wanted to see what survives.

7am - Started strong. AI researched 50 leads before I finished my coffee. Prep docs ready. CRM updated. I felt like a genius.

9am - First crack. AI sent a follow-up to a prospect I closed a deal with last week. "Just checking in to see if you're still interested." He replied: "My friend, I already paid you."

11am - Things got weird. AI responded to my business partner on Slack. He asked about our Q1 strategy. AI said: "I'd be happy to schedule a call to discuss further." He calls me and asks: "Why are you being weird?"

1pm - The disaster. A warm lead replied asking for pricing. AI sent our full rate card - to a competitor who had booked a call under a fake name.

I didn't catch it for 3 hours.

4pm - I pulled the plug.

But here's what I didn't expect: Some things actually worked better without me.

What AI crushed: 
→ Lead research and enrichment - faster than any human 
→ CRM hygiene - updated every record perfectly 
→ Meeting prep docs - ready before every call 
→ Data entry - flawless

What AI destroyed: 
→ Anything requiring context or memory 
→ Conversations with people who know me 
→ Judgment calls on sensitive deals 
→ Knowing when NOT to reply

Here's what I learned: AI isn't ready to replace you. Not even close.
But it's absolutely ready to do the work you hate - the manual, repetitive, soul-crushing stuff that eats 20 hours of your week.

The founders winning right now aren't replacing themselves. They're automating the boring stuff and showing up where it matters. 

That's the play. 

Would you run a similar experiment?

The breakthrough insight here isn't that AI failed. It's where it failed. AI doesn't understand narrative. It sees each interaction as isolated. The real win isn't "AI does the boring stuff so I can relax." It's "AI handles the foundation so I can operate at 100% where it actually counts."

This is the worst it will ever be. If you track how AI has improved over the last couple of years, it is obvious where this is going. One warning though. Until AI is provably reliable, do not hand it anything that could destroy you if it gets it wrong.

Honest question: do you think this kind of AI can be trained to avoid these mistakes over time, or is this less a training issue and more a hard limit around context, judgment, and relational nuance?

We do something similar but in smaller chunks. Pick one workflow, let AI handle it for a week, see what breaks. Then refine the boundaries.

The pattern you found holds: research and prep work? AI wins. Anything with relationship context? Keep it human.

The trick is finding those boundaries before a competitor gets your rate card.
