## Original Post

The history of software is really the history of how humans interact with computers. A (partial) history of user interfaces: TUI: (Terminal User Interface): Type & Read GUI (Graphical User Interface): Point & Click MUI (Mobile User Interface): Touch & Swipe VUI (Voice User Interface): Speak & Listen CUI (Chat User Interface): Prompt & Respond In the age of AI, here's where we're headed: EUI (Emergent User Interface): Generate & Adapt Where we're headed is having UIs be generated, fluid...dynamic. UIs of the feature will be outcome-oriented. What's the best UI to show to *this* user to get to the outcome needed? And, most importantly, like most things in AI, *context* is going to be super-important. This is why I'm excited for the work we're doing around context at HubSpot -- and what creates opportunity for companies that deeply understand their customers/users. To create the best possible UI to deliver the best possible outcomes you need the best possible context.

And some things come full circle. More and more often, I'm reverting to deploying terminal user interfaces to manage my software agents and orchestration for the workflows I build and use day-to-day in my work as opposed to a web interface or something more complex. I just find its a simpler, more compact response to providing input to what are generally autonomous systems.

GUI trained humans to use software. EUI trains software to work for humans. I believe that once EUI takes over, GUI will just be a story we tell.

Brilliant visualization of interface evolution! Each transition roughly correlated with a 10x expansion in user base. Terminal: millions. GUI: hundreds of millions. Mobile: billions. If EUI follows the pattern, we're looking at interfaces that adapt to context before we even ask. What does EUI look like in your vision?

As interfaces become fluid, predictability moves out of the UI and into the system behind it. That puts the pressure on how context is governed and how decisions get made over time.

The shift I see: we went from designing FOR users to designing WITH users. EUI is that transition. The interface isn't handed down anymore. It's co-created in real time based on context and intent. Next phase might be designing AS users, where AI acts on our behalf entirely.

## Notes

- Dharmesh is major tech influencer (1.17M followers, HubSpot co-founder)
- His EUI concept maps to my "for/with/as" design evolution framework:
  - Pre-2025: Design FOR users (static interfaces)
  - 2026-2030: Design WITH users (EUI - Generate & Adapt)
  - 2030+: Design AS users (AI acts on behalf)
- Ross Rader's TUI comment is interesting - full circle observation
- Sambit's "EUI trains software" reframe aligns with my framework
- Comment positions EUI as the current transition point in design evolution
