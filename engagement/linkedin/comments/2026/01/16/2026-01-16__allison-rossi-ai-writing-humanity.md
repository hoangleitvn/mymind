## Original Post

If you've been using AI to "write" your posts for you and think no one can tell — you're probably wrong. A lot of people tell me that they've "trained" AI to write in their voice — they are usually wrong. It's much more likely that AI has slowly and subtly trained you to sound like AI — not the other way around. The AI-ification of LinkedIn has resulted in a more obvious sea of sameness, but the sameness isn't new. LinkedIn thought leaders have been copying each other forever. They've been recycling the same tired advice and sharing the same billboard quotes. Forever. So the sameness isn't new — AI just created more of it. And to be clear, I've never said using AI is wrong, but I'll say it again: AI is not a writer. Your voice should be yours — not AI. There's enough bullying on LinkedIn. People are bullied about using AI when they use it AND when they don't. So, I'm not here to bully people for using AI, but it's important to understand what is happening when you rely on it too heavily. And it's not because of AI "red flags" — it's much simpler than that. Your writing loses its humanity. People think they can spot AI by stupid "tells" — they can't. If you think you can detect AI by one thing — you're wrong. If you think AI detectors can detect their way out of a paper bag — you're wrong. And if you think just not using em dashes is fooling anyone — you're wrong 🙃 Thank you for coming to my AI rant. #AllisonWith2Ls #And152EmDashes

I (still) can't believe this has to be said. While I (and many others) are soooo done with the AI police all over this platform... AI is a GREAT partner to work through content, ideas, problem solving, etc. But it's up to you to carry the ball across the goal line.

My point is, yes, sometimes it is very obvious that content is AI generated. Other times, people with a stronger English background are now being accused of using AI every time we speak naturally. I will actually go back and insert mistakes into something I wrote from scratch just to avoid the "AI generated this because I wouldn't be able to" mentality.

I keep a list of 100+ banned words and patterns to fight exactly this. The effort is real. Without active pushback, the default is absorption. You start sounding like AI without noticing.
