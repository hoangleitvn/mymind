## Original Post

"I don't have time to post to LinkedIn" is a lie. 60 mins a day can change your visibility forever. 99% consume, only 1% create. The top 1% of that 1% dominate. They're not lucky. They're consistent. They treat LinkedIn like a growth channel. Not a distraction.

This platform is a goldmine for visibility and revenue. The algorithm isn't ignoring you - you're ignoring it:

15 mins: Engage before posting
↳ Comment on 5–7 posts from peers, leaders, and ICPs.
↳ Share standout posts with your take to add value.
↳ Build a creator circle to boost early engagement.

15 mins: Create and publish
↳ Use a saved idea and run it through Stanley.
↳ It writes like you - not like generic AI slop.
↳ Keep it skimmable: hook → value → CTA.

15 mins: Engage after you post
↳ Reply to comments with speed and substance.
↳ Ask follow-ups, share insights, keep it flowing.
↳ Don't post and ghost - turn it into dialogue.

10 mins: DMs & relationship building
↳ Reply to every DM with warmth and purpose.
↳ Start 1–2 chats with recent connections or fans.
↳ Lead with value, not pitches - stay top of mind.

5 mins: Build your network
↳ Send 5–7 connection requests with intent.
↳ Prioritise engaged users and ICP matches.
↳ Grow your audience, not just your numbers.

LinkedIn rewards consistency, clarity, and connection. This system is how top creators stay top of mind.

It takes more than an hour a day to do a great job (like you), especially when you haven't developed the skills yet, but you're right that "I don't have time" is BS. It's all about priorities!

Whats the thinking/evidence behind the 'warming up the algorithm' Instinctively it makes sense, you interact for 15 minutes and therefore the people you interact with are likely to see your post (both a psychological and algorithm effect). Does this proliferate through the algorithm? Or is this purely a human network thing?

"Don't post and ghost" is the real insight here.

Original post gets you visibility. Replies get you remembered. The comments section is where relationships actually form.
  strategy: "add-experience - focus on engagement value, ignore promotional pitch"

## Notes

- High-follower LinkedIn coach/creator (189k followers)
- Post is promotional (selling AI Creators Club) but has genuine advice mixed in
- "Don't post and ghost" is the actionable insight worth highlighting
- Ignored the promotional pitch, engaged with the useful content only
- The 60 mins daily might burn people out. Jacob Zangel's comment acknowledges this.
- Paul Kent's question about algorithm vs network effects is interesting - worth exploring
