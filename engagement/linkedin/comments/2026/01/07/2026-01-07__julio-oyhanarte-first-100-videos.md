## Original Post

Your first 100 videos will be bad. Make them anyway. I look back at my early videos and I barely recognize myself. Awkward delivery. Bad lighting. Rambling explanations. I said "um" every three seconds. If I had waited until I was "ready," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what nobody tells you about content creation: You don't get good and THEN start posting. You start posting and THEN get good.

Every video teaches you something:
- Video 1: You learn how uncomfortable it feels to talk to a camera.
- Video 10: You start finding your rhythm.
- Video 25: You figure out what hooks work.
- Video 50: You stop saying "um" every sentence.
- Video 75: You can explain complex ideas simply.
- Video 100: You finally sound like yourself.

Each video makes you 1% better. That doesn't sound like much. But 1% compounded over 100 videos? That's mastery.

Same applies to writing. My first posts were painful to read. Overthought, overwritten, trying too hard.

Somewhere around post 50, I stopped writing for an imaginary audience and started writing what I actually think. That's when it clicked.

The reps matter more than the plan.
  strategy: "Add Experience - extend the principle to writing with personal parallel"

## Notes

- Universal principle that applies beyond video to any creative output
- Aligns with my "ship early, learn fast" thinking
- Low engagement post but solid message
- Could reference this principle in my own content about learning by doing
