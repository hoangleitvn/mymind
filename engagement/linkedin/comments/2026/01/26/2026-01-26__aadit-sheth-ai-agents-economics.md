## Original Post

AI agents work now. The economics don't. There's an open-source project called Clawdbot blowing up right now. 5,000+ GitHub stars in a few weeks. It runs on your own hardware, connects to WhatsApp or Telegram, and handles emails, calendars, coding tasks — all without a subscription. The hype is everywhere. Screenshots. "I automated my entire life." "This is the future." Then one user posted something that made me stop scrolling: "I just gave Clawdbot a task and after 4 messages back and forth, it made a reservation at a restaurant for me! After another 6 texts, it sent a calendar invite! And it only cost me $87 in Opus 4.5 tokens! AGI is here man!" He was joking. But he also wasn't. I've felt a version of this myself. I was on Claude's $20/month Pro plan. Multiple times I'd hit the usage limit mid-task and have to wait 1-3 hours for it to reset. Couldn't do anything. Eventually I upgraded to the Max plan because I was basically forced to. With ChatGPT or Gemini, $20/month gets you pretty far. With Claude Opus 4.5, you hit the wall fast. To be fair, the actual monthly cost for something like Clawdbot is reasonable ($25-150/month depending on usage). But the per-task economics? That's where it breaks down. Everyone's posting what AI can do. Almost nobody's talking about what it costs to do it. We're in the "impressive demo, impractical economics" phase. The cost curve will come down. It always does. Competition and development will fix this eventually. But right now, the real race isn't capabilities. It's efficiency. Whoever cracks that wins everything.

What people are excited about: • Agents doing everything • Hands free automation • AGI vibes What actually matters right now: • Cost per task • Token efficiency • Right model for the job Capability sells. Economics decides adoption.

depends on what we're comparing per-task cost to. The mistake people make is to compare that to software runs cost. Because software has never been able to do these kinds of things before. Making restaurant reservation type task always belonged to humans. And the comparison should be made against human time/cost spent for the given task. And how does the AI cost compare. You'll find AI cost is vastly lower than a human doing that task.

The winning layer won't build smarter agents first. It will make intelligence economically boring to run.

The per-task economics hit different when you're building with AI daily. I tracked my Opus usage for a month. The pattern: complex tasks that save hours cost dollars. Simple tasks that save minutes cost the same dollars. The efficiency gap isn't just about cheaper tokens. It's about smarter task routing.
