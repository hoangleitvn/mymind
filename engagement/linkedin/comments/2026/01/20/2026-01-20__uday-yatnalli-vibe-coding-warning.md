## Original Post

"Vibe coding" is not a flex. It's a warning sign.

The devs getting the most out of AI coding? They're the ones with strong fundamentals who treat the AI like a fast junior dev with infinite patience, not a replacement for thinking.

Key practices:
1. Specification-first approach - Create CLAUDE.md files with context and constraints before writing code
2. Granular commits - Break work into small, testable units as recovery points
3. Contextual awareness - Provide relevant documentation and code snippets to the AI
4. Human oversight - Recognize that AI produces confident but potentially buggy outputs

The "AI like a fast junior dev" framing is accurate. Same skill gap: juniors miss edge cases, make confident mistakes, need constraints.

CLAUDE.md as spec works because it makes constraints explicit before execution starts. Most teams skip this and debug their way to structure instead.

My take: Workflow first, skills second, tools last. Design how you work, then upgrade what you know, then pick the tool. The devs struggling with AI? Often chasing the latest model instead of fixing their workflow.

The "debug your way to structure" pattern is so real. CLAUDE.md upfront = fewer surprises later. Treating it like onboarding docs for a new hire (but one who reads EVERYTHING) makes the mental model click. Constraints before execution is the move.

Exactly. And like onboarding docs, CLAUDE.md works best when it says what NOT to do, not just what to do. Boundaries over instructions.
