## Original Post

Benedict L. shared article from BetaNews about development predictions for 2026:
- Citizen developers dominate
- Rise of AI in development
- "Code as the new Latin"

Key quote: "the developer's new core skill is leveraging advanced tooling to validate AI-generated code at scale"

Advocates "trust and verify" methodology for maintaining security and quality standards.

    "Trust and verify" is a solid starting point. The next evolution: trust and specify.

    Verification catches problems after they happen. Specification prevents them upfront. When you understand how models default to certain patterns, you can shape output before writing a single prompt.

    The real skill shift isn't just validation tooling - it's knowing what to ask for in the first place.
  strategy: "Position L3+ framework as evolution beyond reactive verification. Acknowledge post value while extending the thinking."
```

## Notes

- Low engagement post (2 likes, 0 comments) - early commenter opportunity
- Connects directly to our L2→L3 AI coding framework
- "Trust and verify" = Level 2 (reactive validation)
- "Trust and specify" = Level 3+ (proactive behavior shaping)
- Potential for follow-up if author responds
