  key_points:
    - CS education shifted from systems design to shipping speed
    - LLMs trained on buggy code creates feedback loop of mediocrity
    - Abstraction without understanding = systems no one can secure
    - Software lacks professional standards like civil engineering
    - Cloud outages prove speed is not proxy for stability
    - Architectural shortcuts accumulate over time

## Original Post

Nick Thompson argues the agentic revolution hype masks a fundamental crisis: industry prioritizes speed over rigor, creating fragile systems on contaminated foundations.

Key quote: "Speed is not a proxy for stability"

Critical of:
- LLM training on buggy code ("feedback loop of mediocrity")
- Abstraction without understanding
- Lack of professional standards in software vs civil engineering

Valid concerns. The "abstraction without understanding" pattern is real.

What I'm seeing: teams vibe coding without workflow or context management. Months later, they've lost all reasoning behind decisions. Some restart from zero.

The fix isn't rejecting AI tooling - it's treating specification and context as first-class deliverables, not afterthoughts.

Foundation first. Then let the tools amplify.
  strategy: "Acknowledge valid concerns without full pessimism, add real observation about vibe coding, offer constructive path forward with foundation-first framing"
```

## Notes

- Skeptical/critical post - engaged constructively without dismissing concerns
- Reframed from "AI is the problem" to "weak foundation is the problem"
- Reused vibe coding observation - consistent messaging across engagements today
- "Foundation first. Then let the tools amplify." - clean closing that captures brand
- Aligns with builds-that-last philosophy
