## Original Post

Matt Watson argues AI-assisted coding is acceptable, but human engineers must remain responsible for production code. Professional oversight is non-negotiable.

Key points:
- Someone must understand tradeoffs, edge cases, failure modes
- Production serves others, demands higher standards
- "Works on my machine" is insufficient
- AI is a tool; human judgment about risk can't be outsourced

100% agreed. 

"AI wrote it" is the new "it works on my machine."

To me: AI is a tool, and judgment is the job.

The engineers getting consistent results aren't just better reviewers - they specify what good looks like before the first line is generated. Tradeoffs, edge cases, failure modes. Front-loaded, not discovered in production.

Same responsibility. Earlier in the process.
  strategy: "Punchy opener with memorable parallel, reinforce tool vs judgment distinction, pivot to specification-first framing, close with 'same responsibility, earlier' reframe"
```

## Notes

- "AI wrote it = works on my machine" - strong quotable opener, potential standalone content
- Balanced/pragmatic post - aligned with our views, extended with specification angle
- Consistent messaging: front-loading thinking, not just reviewing output
- Clean close: "Same responsibility. Earlier in the process."
