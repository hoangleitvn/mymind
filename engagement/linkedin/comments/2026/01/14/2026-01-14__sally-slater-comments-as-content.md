## Original Post

Comments are doing more work on LinkedIn right now than most people's posts. I've had comments that hit 30K impressions in less than a day (see pic as proof). With my regular posts, I'm lucky if I hit 2,000. To quote Jessica Aries, who inspired me to write this post, "Comments are not an afterthought. They are content." But they also serve a purpose in increasing the reach of your own LinkedIn posts. I've talked before about how LinkedIn rolled out a new AI brain for ranking and recommendations in 2025. The biggest shift: the algorithm no longer prioritizes content based on who you know (your connections) but on what you care about (your topics). This transition means your feed is now populated by AI-driven interest clusters that serve content based on your specific engagement history and professional relevance, regardless of whether you are connected to the creator. What does that have to do with comments? Every comment you write is logged as prompt data that trains the algorithm on your expertise. When you leave a comment, you provide a real-time example that helps the system predict that you (and people like you) should see similar content in the future. The algorithm also rewards reciprocity. If you thoughtfully engage with a prospect or peer, the system increases the probability of pulling your next post into their feed. Cool cool cool, so what does that mean practically? → 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐮𝐦𝐩: Comment on 3-5 posts 15-45 minutes before you publish your own post. Prioritize posts on related topics from creators in adjacent spaces. → 𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲: Mix prospects, clients, influencers, and industry peers (your colleagues won't extend your reach the same way) → 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐢𝐭 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭: Comment early on influencer posts (within the first hour, under 20 comments) for massive impressions → 𝐀𝐝𝐝 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞: The algorithm rewards depth. Bring perspective instead of just saying "Great post!" or restating what's already there. → 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐀𝐈 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐰𝐚𝐲: Leverage AI to help you surface comment opportunities and provide initial ideas on how to respond. Layer in your own thinking. AI comment spam is obvious and annoying. How often are you commenting? And are you doing it intentionally, or just whenever you feel like it? #linkedintips #360brew #linkedinmarketing #socialmedia #socialmediatips

Sally, I've seen the same thing, not on the same scale as your example, but my top 5 impressions have all come from comments on other people's posts. A solid comment can travel farther than a "pretty good" post because it's attached to someone else's distribution.

One caution: if people treat comments as a growth hack, the feed quickly fills with polite noise. The cost is that you train your audience (and yourself) to skim, not think.

What's worked best for me is a simple rule: one specific observation, one consequence, then stop. If I can't add that, I don't comment. It keeps the "prime the pump" idea from turning into performance.

Also, "logged as prompt data" is a useful way to describe it. Your comment history is basically your algorithm résumé.

I just want to echo what you said here about AI comments. They are so obvious. Please avoid AI comments. Instead, consider sharing a story and adding to the convo, gives an example of the post in action, or asking a question that actually draws from the post content.

Learned this the same way. Engage before posting, share comments that add context or push back. My workflow: let AI draft something first to see how it handles my context, then revise and add my angle. AI gets me started. My angle makes it stick.
