Nice, finally. So tired of always pointing out exactly how to use my projects testbench.

Nice. Are there any skills available out of the box? Also can the skills created for Claude Code work by simply copying them to .agent/skills/

Yes! I got excited as soon as I read the changelog, but then I couldn't find the docs on how to implement it. Thanks! Philipp Schmid

Love seeing Agent Skills as an open standard (agentskills.io). Been building skills and a marketplace for Claude Code. The model-agnostic part is the hard problem. Each model expects skills in different structures and paths. Curious how you've approached that so far?
  strategy: "Add Context + Ask - share experience building skills, ask about the hard problem"

## Notes

- Second engagement with Philipp (first was Agent Harness post)
- Post is very fresh (38 min old) - good timing for visibility
- Comments already asking about Claude Code skill compatibility - same question I have
- High priority connection for AI tooling discussions
