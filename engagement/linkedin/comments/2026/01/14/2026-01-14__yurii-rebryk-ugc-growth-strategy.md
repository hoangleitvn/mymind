  key_points:
    - Quantity beats quality - 100+ videos daily, 90% flop, top 10% drives growth
    - Consistency is non-negotiable - 2-3 videos daily per account for months
    - Repurpose everything - same video across TikTok, IG, YouTube, Facebook
    - Repeat what works - recreate winning videos with different creators
    - Study trends - copy what's proven, then adapt
    - Small creators > big influencers - faster, cheaper, more motivated
    - Pay based on results - base fee + performance bonus
    - Track revenue, not likes - UTM links to full funnel

## Original Post

2024: No revenue, no social presence. 2026: $6M+ in ARR, 1.5B social media views & 7M+ followers - all organic. How did we pull this off at Fluently (AI English tutor, GetFluently.app)? Not by luck - by following a system that actually works. Here are out strategy for to scaling UGC on social media 👇 1) Quantity beats quality With UGC, you never know what will go viral. We posted across dozens of accounts, and while 90% flopped, the top 10% drove all the growth. 2) Consistency is non-negotiable We published 2–3 videos daily from each account. That is 100+ videos DAILY! For the first two months, almost nothing worked, but each video was a test. We kept tweaking scripts, actors, and hooks until one version clicked. That one video became a formula we scaled across channels. 3) Repurpose everything We shared every video on TikTok, IG Reels, YouTube Shorts, and Facebook. No changes, just copy and paste, which easily 2-3x'd our reach. 4) Repeat what works Whenever a video performed well, we immediately recreated it with different creators. Same concept, new face and often 5-10x the total views. UGC is not about being original every time. It's about finding what works and running it back. 5) Study trends like it's your job Half of our workflow is just watching what's trending. We track popular formats, viral hooks, and what's working for others. First we copy it, then we adapt it to our style. Guessing wastes time, start with what's proven. 6) Small creators > big influencers We work with creators who have fewer than 5K followers. They're faster, easier to work with, and much more motivated. 7) Pay based on results We keep it simple: a small base fee plus a bonus if the video performs. If the video works, everyone wins - if not, no big loss. 8) Track revenue, not likes Likes and views are nice, but they don't pay the bills. We use UTM links to track the full funnel: view → click → signup → revenue. If a creator's videos don't convert, we move on.

Scale like this only looks chaotic from the outside. The real discipline is treating content as a testing system tied to revenue, not creativity theater.

Outside our niche. This is social media marketing/UGC growth strategy, not engineering, AI adoption, or technical architecture.

Good strategy to reference but not aligned with our positioning:
- Engineering leadership
- AI adoption (workflow-first)
- Technical foundations

The systematic approach is solid - treat content as testing, track revenue not vanity metrics, repeat what works. Worth remembering for our own content strategy, but not a post we should comment on professionally.
