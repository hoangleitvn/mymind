## Original Post

The future of work is not off on the horizon. It is here now, moving fast, shaped by the choices we make today. AI is already changing how we learn, how we create, and how we move forward. The real question is not what the technology can do. The real question is what we choose to do with it. Moments like this do not just test our skills. They reveal our character and our willingness to lead this moment. That is why, on behalf of all LinkedIn and Microsoft employees, Aneesh Raman and I wrote Open to Work: How to Get Ahead in the Age of AI. We wrote it for everyone navigating this moment of profound change. For every person asking what comes next for their job, their career, their company, or their community. The book is simple by design. It clears away the noise and helps you see what is changing and why. It gives you a practical way to take control of your own path. It helps you understand your strengths, build new capabilities, and make choices that open doors instead of close them. Because here is the truth. Technology can be remarkable. But it cannot dream. It cannot care. It cannot lead. Only people do that. When we stay curious, when we keep learning, when we move forward even in uncertain moments, we shape what becomes possible. Open to Work publishes March 31 and is available for preorder now.

This feels like the real gap in most "age of AI" conversations. The issue isn't just who learns the tools fastest, it's how we read the work they're doing with them. Modern work now operates inside systems, not tasks. But most career advice and job structures still treat output as if it's linear and self‑contained. We already know how to read systemic work in other fields: doctors are evaluated on judgment under uncertainty and coordination in regulated environments; teachers at the intersection of instruction, safeguarding, and behavioural leadership. The same is true for people learning to work with AI. The differentiator won't be prompt tricks. It'll be the human capability to interpret, question, and sometimes override what the system suggests—and to make decisions that hold up under real‑world pressure.

If you're waiting for the 'AI dust to settle' before taking control of your career, you've already lost the lead to those who realize that leadership isn't automated, it's earned through adaptability.

Building with AI daily, the differentiator isn't knowing the tools. It's knowing when to override the AI's suggestion. The machine is fast but can't judge context, stakes, or downstream effects. That judgment is the human edge. Curious how the book frames building that capability.
  strategy: "Add Context - share builder's perspective on what actually differentiates, end with genuine curiosity about book"
