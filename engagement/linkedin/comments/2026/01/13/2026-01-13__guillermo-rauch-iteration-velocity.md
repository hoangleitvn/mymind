## Original Post

There's an app I use regularly that's defective. I'm weighing in my mind whether I should send feedback and hope it gets attention from its creators, or re-build it with AI from scratch. This is a tiny app so it's plausible for me to do it. But if you're in the business of selling software, this is how your every customer is thinking now, or how they'll be thinking soon. Iteration velocity matters more than ever before. How quickly you fix, improve, and ship is your counter-signal.

The buy vs build equation has clearly shifted. High-quality software isn't a commodity yet, but it's getting close. We're about to see a lot more small, focused software built to solve one problem for a specific audience, because now it's realistic to do so.

Iteration velocity does matter more than ever before, but the speed of building isn't the only consideration. Soon you become that creator others want attention from. For a tiny app for personal use, that's probably fine, but the complexity and cost of ownership increases with scale.

All I keep hearing is speed, speed, and speed. I get speed is important, but what about quality and making intentional decisions?

The "I'll just rebuild it" mindset is becoming a trap. Building is the easy part now. Maintaining it? That's where AI can't save you.

I'm seeing teams chase feature velocity while their customers just want the thing they already paid for to work. Speed to ship isn't the same as speed to happy customers.
  strategy: "Push Back - challenge the rebuild assumption, highlight TCO and maintenance reality"
