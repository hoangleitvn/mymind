  theme: "AI coding agent standardization"
  angle: "Pick one agent, go deep - freedom to choose kills productivity"
  key_points:
    - Each dev choosing their own coding agent prevents 2x productivity
    - Agents and models are complex, require deep commitment
    - Recommends picking one agent with one model and becoming experts
    - Unifying beats freedom of choice for team transformation

## Original Post

"Here, each dev gets to choose their coding agent." And that's why you're not seeing 2x productivity yet. That's the reality I'm seeing in most companies that are trying to adopt AI-first coding. Instead of unifying around a single agent and model, we're giving team members the freedom to pick and choose as they see fit. However, this is one of the worst strategies I can think of for transforming your engineering teams through AI. Agents and models are so different and complex that each requires deep commitment to deliver their best results. If you're not seeing your roadmap get shipped at least 2x faster yet, consider choosing one agent with one model, and becoming experts at it. I don't care which one you choose, just pick one and go deep.

I think this frames the problem backwards. The bottleneck isn't that teams are using too many agents. It's that they're treating agents like individual tools instead of a system. The teams that feel slower aren't failing because of choice. They're failing because they haven't designed an orchestration layer yet. Depth matters. But composition matters more.

Tool choice feels like autonomy, but it often blocks compounding learning. Standardizing on one agent lets teams build shared intuition and workflows, which is where real velocity starts to show up.

One agent, one model is a strong stance. What do you lose by not experimenting across tools?

Don't fully agree. Models perform differently depending on how you prompt them, hence, what works well for 1 dev, may not be great for another. Nightmare for tracking adoption and costs though.

The tool isn't the bottleneck. The workflow is.

Standardizing on one agent helps with shared learning. But I've seen teams standardize on Cursor, Claude Code, or Copilot and still not see 2x gains. The missing piece: they never mapped the workflow first. What does done look like? Where does validation happen?

Pick one tool, yes. But define the workflow before you go deep.
  strategy: "Add Context mode - validate standardization point but reframe to workflow-first"

## Notes

- Good discussion in comments with both agreement and pushback
- MOHAMED JADIB's counter-argument about orchestration is thoughtful
- Opportunity to add workflow-first perspective as third angle
- Aligns with my "tool is 20%, workflow is 80%" framework
