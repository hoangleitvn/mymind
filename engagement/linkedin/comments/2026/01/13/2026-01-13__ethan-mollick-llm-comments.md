## Original Post

The sheer volume of LLM-written comment-shaped text on this site is reaching the point where it is not worth reading any comments. And yes, the first comment to this post is likely something like: "What an insightful point. Real truth: the LLM comments are not just annoying -- they are signs that we may be losing the voice of humanity itself." At least give your model an interesting prompt or perspective or something.

And the vapid LLM-written posts make the platform so much less fun to visit. At least before the uninteresting posts were uninteresting in their own unique ways. Now they are homogeneously bad

The current algorithm massively overweights the exposure one gets from early, high engagement comments on big accounts - certainly incentivizes slop, but also just cranking comments quickly which, ironically, converges to auto-generated slop.

This is true. I use AI to help me write comments, but with my voice and my knowledge base loaded. First, I let AI draft something to see how it behaves with my context. Then I revise and add my angle.

Four modes I use: Add Context, Push Back, Ask, or Amplify. Pick one. If it doesn't fit any of these, I probably have nothing worth saying.
  strategy: "Add Context - share personal method for AI-assisted commenting, directly responds to his 'give your model an interesting prompt' challenge"
