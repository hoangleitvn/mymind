## Original Post

I gave up coding for 6 months. It was the hardest thing I've done. It was my meditation. My flow state. The thing that made me feel useful. Now, I felt.. like an impostor. No commits. No PRs. No "good job" on a feature. Just meetings. Docs. Context-setting. And a growing fear: Am I even adding value? But I had to do it. I was preparing a project for 30+ engineers working at once. If I kept coding, I'd slow everyone down. If I let go, I could make their jobs easier. So I let go. And here's what I learned: - The best code you write is the system you build for others to thrive in. - Leadership isn't about doing more work. - It's about doing different work. Giving up code felt like a step back. It was actually the only way forward.

The hardest part is the identity change. But the impact is real when teams can execute without being blocked on one person.

Being a Technical Lead, I need to do a lot of unsexy work: Meetings, talking with stakeholders, planning sprints, emails, that urgent production issue, reports, interviews, 1v1s, code reviews. And the rest of the time? Designing systems, writing some code.

This resonates. We coach our leaders the same way:

As an IC, your value = code you ship.
As a leader, your value = code your team ships.

Some feel like losing because they code less. But it's multiplication, not subtraction. You still write - just different things: architecture decisions, standards, code reviews. Things that help the team build better.

The failure modes I see: leaders who get promoted but keep coding (bottleneck), or leaders who step back completely (team drifts). The balance is focus on alignment, support, and autonomy - not abandonment.
  strategy: "Add Context - share coaching experience + nuance on what leaders should write instead"
