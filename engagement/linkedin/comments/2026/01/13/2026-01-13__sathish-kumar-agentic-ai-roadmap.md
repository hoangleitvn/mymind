  theme: "Agentic AI as engineering discipline"
  angle: "Beyond prompt chaining - full-stack AI engineering"
  key_points:
    - Agentic AI is a full engineering discipline, not just prompt chaining
    - 11 layers: programming, LLMs, tools, frameworks, orchestration, memory, RAG, deployment, monitoring, security
    - Frameworks help but fundamentals still matter
    - No monitoring means silent failures
    - Autonomy without control is dangerous

## Original Post

𝐌𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐩𝐞𝐨𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐀𝐈 𝐢𝐬 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐭𝐬.
That belief will hold you back in 2026.
Agentic AI is a Full-Engineering discipline.

𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞'𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐀𝐈 𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐝𝐦𝐚𝐩 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟔:

𝟏. 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠
Agents are software first.
- Core languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell
- API requests using HTTP and JSON
- Prompt engineering, context management, task planning prompts
- Self-critique and retry loops

Without this, agents can't act reliably.
---

𝟐. 𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐈 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬
This is where agents become goal-driven.
- Understanding what AI agents really are
- Autonomous vs semi-autonomous agents
- Goal decomposition and task planning algorithms
- Self-reflection and feedback loops

This defines how agents think and decide.
---

𝟑. 𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐏𝐈𝐬
Models are the brain, but choice matters.
- Proprietary models like GPT-based systems
- Open-source LLMs
- API authentication and rate limiting

Wrong model choices break agent behavior.
---

𝟒. 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Agents are only powerful if they can act.
- File reader and writer tools
- Python execution tools
- External API calling
- Search and retrieval tools
- Memory integration

This turns reasoning into execution.
---

𝟓. 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬
Frameworks accelerate development, not thinking.
- LangChain
- AutoGen
- Flowise
- Haystack
- CrewAI

Frameworks help, but fundamentals still matter.
---

𝟔. 𝐎𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Agents need control, not chaos.
- DAG-based workflow management
- Graph-based orchestration

This prevents runaway agents.
---

𝟕. 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭
Good agents remember the right things.
- Short-term memory
- Long-term memory
- Episodic memory
- Vector stores like Pinecone and Weaviate

Memory shapes agent intelligence over time.
---

𝟖. 𝐊𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐥𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐑𝐀𝐆
Agents must ground answers in data.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Embedding models
- Document indexing
- Query refinement and hybrid search
- LangChain RAG and LlamaIndex RAG

This reduces hallucinations.
---

𝟗. 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭
Agents must run in the real world.
- API-based deployment
- Streamlit apps
- Docker and Kubernetes
- Vector database hosting
- Agent hosting platforms

A working agent is a deployed agent.

---
𝟏𝟎. 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Agents need constant oversight.
- Agent Evaluation metrics
- Human-in-the-loop feedback
- Logging and tracing
- Auto-Evaluation loops

No monitoring means silent failures.

---

𝟏𝟏. 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐆𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
Autonomy without control is dangerous.
- User authentication
- Role-based access control
- Output filtering
- Data privacy

This is non-negotiable for production agents.
Which layer of this roadmap feels the most overwhelming right now?

This is a great way to frame it. I see the same misconception all the time: people think agentic AI is just "clever prompt chaining," when in practice that's the smallest part of the problem. Once you try to run agents in anything resembling a real system, you immediately hit very familiar engineering questions: how do you control blast radius, how do you reason about state and memory, how do you debug decisions made over time...

Prompting gets you a demo. Engineering gets you something you can trust in production.

This is one of the clearest breakdowns of Agentic AI as an engineering discipline, not a prompt trick. The real gaps I see in production are Orchestration, Memory Management, Monitoring, and Governance.

The distinction between model capability and system design is well articulated. Strong architecture choices often outweigh raw model strength in complex workflows.

Agents amplify your workflow. If your process is broken, agents just multiply the breakage.

The roadmap is solid. But most teams jump to frameworks without mapping the workflow first: What does done look like? Where does validation happen? Who owns the final call? Skip that work, and better prompts just produce faster wrong answers.
  strategy: "Add Context mode - validate roadmap + share workflow-first framework questions"

## Notes

- Strong alignment with vibe coding vs engineering theme
- Tarak's comment excellent: "Prompting gets you a demo. Engineering gets you something you can trust in production"
- Good engagement in comments from experienced practitioners
- Connects to our foundation-first, production-readiness messaging
