## Original Post

Overall, I spent months dragging boxes around in Drawio. Every time the infrastructure changed, the diagram was already outdated. That's over now. My new YouTube video shows how to skip manual diagramming completely. Instead of drawing what you think your infrastructure looks like, you let AI discover what it actually is. Using Kiro and MCP servers, the AI can either check your IaC or pull live data from your AWS account and then generate accurate diagrams automatically. It's not perfect, but I think it's definitely good enough! If you're still updating architecture diagrams by hand in 2026, this will change how you work. Link: https://lnkd.in/dqqcw3VF

Manual diagrams are always a snapshot of yesterday's infrastructure. Auto-generated diagrams won't replace architecture thinking, but they eliminate the busywork of keeping docs in sync with reality.

Now with AI we can do a lot more like C4/UML automatically via Mermaid or PlantUML diagrams.
  strategy: "Validate mode - acknowledge pain point + add context about broader diagram automation possibilities"
