## Original Post

While most teams are bragging about how fast they ship code, your focus should be somewhere else: Focus on building the right things, first. Then, use technology to accelerate the rate at which you produce new value. That's how you win in tech in 2026.

The "build the right things first" advice is right, but the hard part is knowing what "right" means before you build it. You can't always know upfront. Sometimes shipping fast is how you discover what's actually right. The balance is between moving fast enough to learn versus moving so fast you build the wrong thing at scale. Teams that only focus on "right things first" end up in analysis paralysis. Teams that only focus on speed end up rebuilding constantly. The skill is knowing when you have enough information to commit versus when you need to ship something small to learn.

Fundamentals will be here for the next 100+ years. That's why it is important to learn and understand them. They are the core building blocks of everything else.

Strong point. Speed without direction just compounds mistakes. AI should reduce waste, not replace fundamentals.

Especially with AI, you need to be intentional about what you build. AI can accelerate output, but only if you give it the right context - and that context comes from truly understanding the problem you're solving. Speed without direction just gets you lost faster.

From building things right to building the right things. Hard shift. Most teams skip clarity at the start and rush to HOW. Even with AI, teams chase the latest model instead of defining workflows that amplify skills, not replace them.

Same tools?
Same structure?
Different approaches
Different results

Most problems are clarity, not technical.

## Notes

- Gregor is a major engineering leadership influencer (72K followers)
- Post aligns directly with our "10 Questions Before Building" content
- Good opportunity to reinforce foundation-first positioning
- Several commenters (Petar, Muhammad, Valeria) echo fundamentals/clarity theme
- Jono's counterpoint about analysis paralysis is valid - worth acknowledging in future content
