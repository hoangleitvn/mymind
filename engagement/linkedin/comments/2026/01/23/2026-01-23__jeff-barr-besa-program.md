## Original Post

Become a Solutions Architect (BeSA) is a free mentoring program designed to help you to excel in your cloud and AI career. The program is free, all you need to do is to invest a few hours a week (preferably Saturday for the live sessions) and you will walk away with updated technical and behavioral skills. The next batch starts on Feb 21, 2026, with sessions hosted live on YouTube every Saturday at 3 PM GMT. Learn more and sign up at https://besaprogram.com/ . You can also review the videos from previous batches at https://lnkd.in/eQwGiskn .

Free mentoring covering technical AND behavioral skills. Most programs skip the behavioral. Worth sharing.
  strategy: "Amplify - signal boost with genuine reason (behavioral skills gap in most programs)"

## Notes

- Jeff Barr is AWS VP/Chief Evangelist - legendary figure in cloud space
- Promotional post for community initiative, not thought leadership
- Amplify mode appropriate - adds value by highlighting the behavioral skills angle
- Low expectation for reply - this is a signal boost, not conversation starter
