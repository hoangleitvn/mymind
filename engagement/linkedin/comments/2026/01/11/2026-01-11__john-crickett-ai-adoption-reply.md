## Context

Replying to John Crickett's comment on a post about AI adoption. His comment:

> I think you are behind if you're not using AI to help you as a software engineer.
> I don't think you'll be replaced though, change happens far slower than people expect.
> Those who never moved past COBOL can still find work.

Agree. The replacement fear is overblown. The real risk is engineers who adopt AI but skip the understanding part. Speed without knowing what you shipped is borrowed time.
  strategy: "Add context - agree with his point and extend with nuance about understanding"

## Notes

- Aligns with our published content on vibe coding awareness
- John is high-priority influencer (200K+ followers)
- Our post from Jan 7 says: "AI won't replace engineers. But engineers who ignore these tools will fall behind."
- This reply extends that thinking with the "understanding" nuance
