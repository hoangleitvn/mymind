Thank you. Though there's no truly complete list - this is an ownership problem at its core.

If engineers care about it, they'll find more items to add. Small saves beat big saves with complex tools. Most teams don't need a FinOps solution. They need to build the culture.

## Notes

- Positive comment on AWS cost checklist post
- Opportunity to reinforce ownership/culture message over tool-first thinking
