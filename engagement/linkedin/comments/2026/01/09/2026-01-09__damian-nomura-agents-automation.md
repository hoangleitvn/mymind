## Original Post

Everyone's talking about agents. Almost no one should be building them yet. The hype is real. The technology is coming. But 90% of executives claim they're confident making AI decisions while only 8% actually possess substantial AI knowledge. That 82-point gap is filled with buzzwords. Agent. Agentic. Automation. Most people think they're the same thing. They're not. An agent operates autonomously. Perceiving its environment, making rational decisions, pursuing goals without constant oversight. What most companies need? Automation. Rules-based workflows that run the same way every time. Not sexy. But it works. And here's the thing: if you can't automate your processes effectively, you're not ready for agentic systems. And you're definitely not ready for true agents. The foundation has to come first. Honest question: Do you know the difference between automation, agentic systems, and agents? Or does it all blur together?

Automation first hits different. Half the companies talking agents haven't even mapped their existing workflows properly. That's where most ROI actually lives right now, not in chasing the sexy new tool.

Most organizations try to skip the Process Architecture phase and go straight to autonomy. If your Rules-Based Automation isnt robust,,, an Agent becomes a High-Speed Hallucination Engine. You can't delegate goals to a system that lacks a stable Operational Foundation. mastery of deterministic workflows is the prerequisite for Agentic orchestration

This is the part people skip: automation first, governance always. The real differentiator isn't 'agentic'—it's whether execution is observable, auditable, and stoppable (no silent continuation, no approval bleed, evidence gates). Build that foundation and then evaluate autonomy.

Damian Nomura in some cases - but so many use cases are not workflow derived. Which is where agents come in - more like coworkers that taking business process

The progression matters: predictable workflow first, then validation and guardrails, then autonomy. Skip steps and agents become expensive chaos.

Same pattern in engineering. Teams want AI code generation before they have reliable CI/CD. Want AI code review before they have consistent standards.

Design the workflow first. See the patterns. Then decide what deserves autonomy.

## Notes

- Strong thesis with specific data point (90% vs 8%)
- Comments are high quality and technical
- Aligns perfectly with my foundation-first positioning
- Ali Husnain's "High-Speed Hallucination Engine" is quotable
- Fergus offers valid counterpoint about non-workflow use cases
