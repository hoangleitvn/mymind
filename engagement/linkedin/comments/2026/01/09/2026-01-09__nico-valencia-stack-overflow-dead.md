    - Stack Overflow dead - developers debug in isolation with AI
    - "A LOT of time spent here" - debugging pain increasing in 2026

## Original Post

Stack Overflow is dead. No one bothers to post solutions anymore.

Developers encounter errors, research yields nothing (platforms like Stack Overflow are "dead"), and they manually debug in isolation. "A LOT of time is spent here, and more developers are feeling this in 2026."

Rather than solutions entering the public domain through SEO, they're captured in "foundation lab databases." These companies are "watching developers solve these problems" and will eventually monetize this data by reselling solutions back to developers.

Companies will pay developers to solve problems, while AI firms profit by licensing those same solutions to millions of other developers—essentially capturing and commercializing collective knowledge that was once freely shared.

    The downstream problem of what I wrote yesterday about documentation collapse.

    StackOverflow was public knowledge. Now it's private data extraction.

    The uncomfortable part: AI companies have no incentive to fix this. Harder debugging = more AI usage = more data capture. The friction is the product.
  strategy: "Connect to my published documentation collapse post, add sharp insight about misaligned incentives."

```

## Notes

- Direct thematic connection to my 2026-01-08 documentation collapse post
- Extends my argument: I said "what trains next models?" - he answers "private data extraction"
- "Friction is the product" is a sharp insight worth developing further
- Potential content angle: the AI knowledge arbitrage business model
