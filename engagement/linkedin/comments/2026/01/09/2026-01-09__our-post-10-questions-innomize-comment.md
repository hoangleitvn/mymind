## Our Engagement

```yaml
- id: 1736418900000
  type: "comment"
  status: "posted"
  sentiment: "positive"
  account: "INNOMIZE"
  content: |
Question 5 is where we catch the most cargo culting with clients.

"Why this tool?" "Because the reference used it."

That's not reasoning. That's copying homework without understanding the assignment.

We don't write code until questions 1-5 have real answers. No exceptions.
  strategy: "Company voice reinforcing framework, sharper tone, calls out cargo culting"
  replies: []
```

## Notes

- Comment from INNOMIZE company account on personal post
- Reinforces the cargo culting point from the main post
- Shows company practice of requiring answers before building
