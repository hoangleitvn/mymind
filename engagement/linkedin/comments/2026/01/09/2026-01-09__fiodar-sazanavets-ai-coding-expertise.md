## Original Post

There are many people talking about AI-assisted software development. But how do you tell whether they genuinely know what they are talking about, or just riding the wave of AI hype and posting stuff for engagements? That's easy! If they say that you still need to know how to code even when you use AI tools - it's quite likely a genuine technical expert who has genuine experience in using these tools to build solid commercial-grade applications. If, however, they say that you no longer need to know how to code, it's definitely someone who hasn't got a clue and is just posting slop for engagements.

I think an important truth you're pointing to is that people working on genuinely hard, high stakes systems discover very quickly that AI doesn't remove the need for deep technical understanding. Where I disagree is in turning that observation into a universal litmus test framed around coding knowledge. Not all valuable software work lives at the "hard distributed systems/performance critical" end of the spectrum. AI meaningfully lowers the bar for other classes of problems, roles, and outcomes.

I broadly agree with the point being made here, but I think the discussion is often framed too narrowly as "knowing how to code" vs. "not needing to code anymore." After two decades of writing software, my last three months have been almost entirely codegen rather than handwritten. Even then, I know how to do it - but I choose generation because it's simply faster.

The skill that matters now: knowing what the AI should have written vs what it actually wrote.

I've been building with Claude Code for months. I type less code than ever. But I read and review more than I used to. The bottleneck shifted from typing to judgment.

People who never coded can't spot when the AI is confidently wrong.

## Notes

- Post creates a binary test, commenters add nuance
- Theo's point about context is valid but doesn't invalidate the core claim
- Michał's experience mirrors mine: less typing, same (more) thinking
- Good opportunity to add specific experience about the judgment shift
