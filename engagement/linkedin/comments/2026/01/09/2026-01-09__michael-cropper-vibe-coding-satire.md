## Original Post

OMG one of our junior software engineers just AI vibe coded a Next Generation App that is about to change everything, forever, everywhere.....

He did it purely using AI on his lunch break while reading our latest RTO Policy and looking forward to the 7pm 3 slices of pizza party on Friday.

He has just sent me the link to it, http://localhost:3000 - I can't access it just yet but he says it's working on his machine.....

Can't wait until he fixes this final bug tomorrow and the world is about to transform!

Just one last step to pass this through our CAB and it should be live in 3 months after another 3 months delay one the security team finds out about this.

That last part stings. You can accelerate engineering all you want, but if your process can keep up it's like having high speed internet and a 1998 modem. And your post pokes a little at the trouble which is trust. Can we trust this works. Can we trust it is secure. Without building the systems to get there the process will always be in the Stone Age.

the security team said it didn't find any issues since none of their tools was able to extract any customer data from the given link. I mean we all know the level on which they operate.

AI wrote it will be the next generation of "it works on my machine". The AI did the easy part. Now the junior gets to learn why the other 90% of the job exists.
  strategy: "Play along with satire while making real point about junior learning and the gap between generating code and shipping it."

## Notes

- Satirical post with good engagement (38 reactions)
- Michael has 10K+ followers, posts humor/satire
- Connects to my vibe coding themes
- "AI wrote it" as evolution of "works on my machine" is worth developing further
