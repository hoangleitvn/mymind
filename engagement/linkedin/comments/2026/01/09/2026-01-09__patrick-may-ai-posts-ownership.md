## Original Post

I stopped creating my posts with AI. Here's why: Currently AI overtakes text and communication, and maybe even mimick humans so well, that it will be indistinguishable, as some claim. But: My language is MY Language. If I outsource what I mean to AI, I don't really own my words anymore. Don't get me wrong - don't see a big issue with editing your ideas. But you are the owner of your words. So you have skin in the game - AI not. And this is your biggest leverage. Could be a general good rule of thumb: Don't outsource to AI where skin in the game is beneficial. How do you guys handle AI and posts? Curious on your thoughts.

    I used to post AI-generated content, but recently stopped doing so for reasons similar to what you've mentioned. - even if it's better than my writing, it's not my writing - I view it as a courtesy thing: it feels weird when other people send me AI-generated messages, so I don't want to do it to them

    I only use AI to do sparring for topics. Last year I used it a lot for content itself, but it felt that I lost touch with my own thoughts or reflections then. So for me content/text posts are more like a personal reflection - something like a journal.

    The skin in the game point is everything. When AI writes your posts, they sound like everyone else's AI-written posts - smooth but soulless. Your actual voice, with its quirks and edge, is what makes people stop scrolling.

    tbf the "here's why: (especially with the ":")" and then the "But:" and the overuse of ":" is pretty clear giveaways that this was generated by AI? :D Image is also clearly ai generated not sure if satire?

    Writing is typing. Thinking is yours.

    AI can make your ideas clearer for readers. The ideas themselves, the perspective, the judgment on what matters - that's still you.

    Your voice, your message. Everything else is fair game.
  strategy: "Add nuance - not anti-AI, but clear on what to keep vs delegate"

## Notes

- Post sparked good discussion on AI in content creation
- Comments show spectrum: some quit AI entirely, some use for sparring only
- Rasmus's comment ironic - calls out AI patterns in a post about not using AI
- Our angle: reframe from AI vs no-AI to what you keep control of
