## Original Post

You can't outsmart bad data. Not with agents. Not with GenAI. Not even with humanoids that salsa and write poetry. If your data is trash, your AI will just make… 💩 but faster. 💩 but with a unicorn emoji. 💩 at scale. Everyone's chasing copilots, agents, and AGI. But skip the "boring" stuff like data quality? And your AI becomes a very expensive fiction writer. Here's what most don't realize: 🔹 Machine Learning needs labeled, trustworthy data 🔹 Generative AI needs high-context, human-like data 🔹 Agentic AI needs clean, structured, real-time data 🔹 Superintelligence? Still needs a foundation it can trust What to do instead: → Map your messy sources → Define "good enough" for each use case → Align teams on what "clean data" actually means → Govern it like your product depends on it (because it does) AI doesn't fail because the models are broken. It fails because the data is.

I mostly agree with this, but I think "bad data" gets blamed for what's really a structure problem. Data is rarely bad. It's usually unscoped, unlabeled, or used outside its intended role. Humans learn from messy, incomplete, and noisy information all the time, because we're taught how to interpret it within a role, a task, and a set of constraints. AI can do the same when designed properly.

This hits the part most teams want to skip. In practice, bad data isn't a technical issue; it's an operational discipline problem. When ownership is unclear, definitions drift, and reporting lives in silos, AI just accelerates the mess.

This is a much-needed reality check. A lot of companies are rushing to deploy agents thinking they'll solve all their problems, but they're ignoring the messy databases underneath. Fixing the data layer is less 'glamorous' than building agents, but it's 100% more important for long-term success.

GIGO applies, but here's the harder problem: when AI fails, you don't always know if it's bad data or bad system design.

Data is like prompts. Bad prompt, bad result. But was the prompt bad, or was the model wrong for the task?

That's why evaluation matters as much as data quality. You need feedback loops to tell you which part is broken.
