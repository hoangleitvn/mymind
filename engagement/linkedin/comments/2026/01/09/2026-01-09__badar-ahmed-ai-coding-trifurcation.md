## Original Post

Stop calling all AI-assisted coding "vibe coding"

Three distinct modes emerging:

**1. Code-first (Traditional Engineering + AI)**
- AI as "fancy auto-complete and code suggestion"
- Tools: GitHub Copilot, IDEs
- Maintains traditional engineering workflows

**2. UI-first (Vibe coding)**
- Focus on rapid iteration and user experience
- Accessible to non-engineers for prototyping
- Tools: Replit, Lovable

**3. Spec-first (Agentic engineering)**
- Specifications and acceptance tests drive development
- Agents orchestrated within constraints and evaluations
- "Most compounding mode for top-tier teams building complex systems"
- Emerging rapidly with Claude Code and Skills extensions

Attribution: Dan Shipper's podcast with Reid Hoffman for the "trifurcation" framing.

Closing question: Which mode are teams currently exploring and which may be under-invested?

Clean taxonomy. The insight that resonates: spec-first is "most compounding for complex systems."

My addition: the specs aren't just for the agent - they force you to think clearly before generating. The discipline of writing acceptance criteria catches edge cases you'd miss in pure vibe coding.

These modes aren't mutually exclusive. Vibe code for exploration with fewer constraints. When the picture is clear, start writing specs.

Curious: how do you write the spec? Self-model plan (like Claude Code plan mode), Spec-kit, or something else?
  strategy: "Validate taxonomy, add nuance about specs forcing clarity, position modes as workflow phases not exclusive choices, ask engaging question about tooling."

        Agree that the modes are not exclusive. I'm hearing folks finding good success in using AI tools like Claude Code plan mode or Cursor plan mode for the spec. Spec kit looks very interesting.

    Claude Code plan mode is my go-to for complex features. Plan mode for architecture decisions, then switch to implementation. The plan becomes the spec - or at least the starting point.

    Spec-kit worth exploring for more structure. I'm building my own spec-driven framework to experiment with different scenarios. Will share more once it's clearer.
  strategy: "Share practical workflow, tease upcoming content on spec-driven development"
```

## Notes

- Strong alignment with my vibe coding vs vibe engineering content
- Spec-first resonates with my "specification hell to vibe coding" post evolution
- He answered: Claude Code plan mode / Cursor plan mode for specs
- Connection request sent after reply exchange
- Teased my spec-driven development framework - content opportunity
- Could lead to content about spec-first tooling comparison
