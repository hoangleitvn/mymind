    I agree with the spirit of this - agency matters. And I've also found that "believe in yourself" is one of those phrases that sounds simple but hides a much harder question underneath: Believe in yourself based on what? For me, belief didn't come from hype or self-talk. It came from making small, owned decisions - and then living with the consequences long enough to trust my judgment.

    Self belief precedes endorsement. Progress begins when responsibility is accepted without delegation. External validation may follow, but it cannot replace inner resolve.

    No one can save you but yourself.

    Blame circumstances, you stay dependent. Do the work, no blame. Small actions. Consistency. Responsibility finds you after that.
