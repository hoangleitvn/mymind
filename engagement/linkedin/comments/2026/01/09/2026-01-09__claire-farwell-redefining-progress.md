## Original Post

I’ve had to rethink what progress means.

I used to think it was about
↳ what’s happening in AI,
↳ what’s new,
↳ what I should be sharing.

And yes, I’ll keep my newsletter.

I’ll keep teaching.

But the more AI accelerates,
the more I’ve felt the need to slow down.

Working in ethical AI
and talking to teams about what AI really means
kept bringing me back to the same place.

The person.
✦ We’re all different.
✦ We all have different values.
✦ Different fears.
✦ Different ways of making sense of things.

And no amount of transparency or governance works
if we don’t stop and check in with ourselves first.

Now feels like the moment to do that.

Before we get lost in the rush.

Before we hand everything over to the machine
without really thinking.

Some of the progress I’ve made this year
no one can see.

2025 has been a hard year in many ways.

A year of change.

And it made me stop and ask questions
I hadn’t been asking enough.

- Do I want this?
- Is this helping me grow?
- Does this feel right?

I realised I’d been rushing.

So I stopped.

And there was a moment where I knew

I was exactly where I needed to be.

Not because it looked impressive.

But because I felt happy.

And I don’t think you can teach,
or communicate,
or lead responsibly in this AI era
unless you understand what makes you happy first.

Lately, progress for me has meant:
☑︎ Being honest with myself
☑︎ Taking time
☑︎ Getting clear

Because if I’m going to stand in a room
and talk about AI, leadership, and the future,
it has to come from that place.

    Simple questions. Hard to answer honestly. The AI acceleration makes slowing down feel wrong - but that's exactly when clarity matters most.
  strategy: "Validate her reflection, connect to AI acceleration paradox."

    Exactly. Everything pulls toward more, faster.

    I had a similar moment. Paused after years of building. Started writing to force clarity on my own thinking.

    What helped you get to "exactly where you needed to be"? Was it the questions themselves, or giving yourself permission to ask them?
  strategy: "Share personal parallel journey, end with question to invite deeper dialogue."
```

## Notes

- Good thread exchange - genuine connection
- Claire has 10K+ followers, writes about ethical AI
- Theme connects to my "Why I'm Writing Again" draft about slowing down
- "Best decisions came from moments you paused" - worth developing as content
