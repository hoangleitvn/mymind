## Original Post

Tailwind didn't "lay off 75% of its team" because of AI. They laid three people off because they're trying to run three business models at once. They behave like: an open source community project, a sponsor-supported public good, a commercial product company. All at the same time. Their homepage feels like open source. They ask for sponsors. They quietly link to a paid product. Each of those choices can make sense on its own. Together, they create confusion. Sponsorships say, "Support us if you want." Sales say, "This creates value worth paying for." Trying to do both, without clearly separating those stories, leaves customers unsure how to engage and teams unsure what they're building toward. That's not an AI problem. It's a go-to-market identity problem. Did you even know they had paid products?

    Tbh, for long I didn't even know they were a company. It's weird to have growth in usage but decline in revenue, but there might be no coloration. AI causes usage growth, economic pressure causes revenue decline.

    Actually purchased their paid product a year or so ago to help keep the development going. It also of course saved us time as well. Seemed obvious to me what they were doing from day one but I was in their docs a lot for awhile there.

    Your question hit hard. Honestly, I didn't know they had paid products. Use their framework daily. Never saw the paid offering.

## Notes

- Matt has 74k followers - good visibility
- His GTM analysis is sharp - not blaming AI like others
- Our honest admission reinforces his point without restating it
- Similar to Itzchak's comment - validates the confusion is real
