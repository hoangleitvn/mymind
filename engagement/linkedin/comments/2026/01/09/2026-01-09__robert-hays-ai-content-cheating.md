## Original Post

Is using AI to help us with content creation really cheating? We ALREADY "cheat" when we write, because the process involves processing the content that OTHERS created when we try to publish something new: we leverage our experience AND the experience of others we have absorbed over our lives. Think about it--whatever you type is coming from your head, but your head contains your life experiences PLUS the information you gathered from OTHERS--written words, things you have heard, videos you have watched, music you have listened to, even advertisements are planted in your brain and you are using all of it in some way! So when a person says "AI is cheating" I wonder, is it really? Or is it just another tool we use to help shape what is unique to us, using a much wider pool of experience? Through prompting, we concoct a unique narrative that reflects where we are at the moment, and in doing so we are leveraging a tool, nothing more. I have been encouraging my clients to lean heavily on AI and prompting to do their work; becoming proficient in guiding AI enables them to produce content at a velocity never seen, once they get proficient with the tool. Of course, any tool can make you lazy--and the old saying still holds true: "If all you have is a hammer, everything you work with becomes a nail." So I counsel my clients to always do their best to make sure their results sound as human as possible, while still retaining the benefits of the LLM they use. We are in a new age, and we may as will stay current!

    Astounding the lengths people will go to justify the use of something they maybe shouldn't be using. No, harnessing learned experience is not the same as prompting artificial "intelligence". And do we really want to live in a world where the goal is to "produce content at a velocity never seen"?

    Use of AI is a moral failing. Once you have justified that, you can justify anything.

    The difference is that, unless we literally plagiarise others work, we are still creating something new from our learned experiences. Whereas with AI, if used in a basic and lazy way to shortcut real effort to produce original content, we are simply handing over the output to an algorithm of others work.

    I learned this phrase the other day and it describes the inclusion of AI in the writing process - regression to the mean. What it means is that AI is programmed to find wordings/grammar that is most common in most of the data it analyzes. Essentially if your work is too far from the norm it will correct it, which flattens the writing.

    The input part is true - we all absorb from others. Output is where it splits. AI expressing your thinking clearer vs AI doing the thinking for you. Same tool, different uses. Keeping your voice, your message yours. Everything else is fair game.
  strategy: "Add nuance - address his input argument, clarify the output distinction. Callback to consistent theme across AI content posts."

## Notes

- Heated comments section - strong anti-AI sentiment from some
- Post conflates input (absorbing/learning) with output (generating)
- Jessica Stone's comment about "velocity" goal is valid critique
- Harper's "regression to the mean" insight is sharp
- Our comment adds nuance without attacking - same theme as Patrick May engagement
