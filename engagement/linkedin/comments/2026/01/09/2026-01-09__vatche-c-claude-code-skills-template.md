## Original Post

One of the best parts of helping teams adopt AI is watching someone's eyes widen when they realize what AI can actually do for them. That moment of possibility... that's why I keep writing and sharing code for free.

If you've been curious about "skills" in Claude Code but haven't jumped in yet, here's your starting point: a template repo with 12 custom slash commands (/test, /commit, /update-docs, etc.).

Dual-file architecture (markdown + bash) so you can customize everything for your stack. Pure bash, zero dependencies, works everywhere.

As always, let me know what you think: positive or negative, it's all welcome.

Solid resource. We use Claude Code with context files loaded on startup, similar purpose. The dual-file architecture is interesting. Does splitting markdown from bash give you better maintainability, or is it more about Claude understanding the intent?
  strategy: "Peer connection. Acknowledge value, share similar workflow, ask genuine question about architecture choice."

## Notes

- Vatche shares free resources for Claude Code adoption
- Dual-file architecture is interesting pattern worth exploring
- Direct overlap with my Claude Code usage
- Good potential connection for AI tooling discussions
