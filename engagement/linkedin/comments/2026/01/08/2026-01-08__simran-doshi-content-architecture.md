## Original Post

Stop showing me your content calendar.
Instead, show me your content architecture.

**The Shift**

| What we're looking at | Content Calendar | Content Architecture |
|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Scope | Surface | Structural |
| Focus | Output | Outcomes |
| Goal | Fill a feed | Answer an objection |
| Driven by | Time | Decision |
| Metric | Volume | Utility |
| Logic | Reactive | Predictive |
| Output | High volume, high noise | High signal, high equity |
| Feeling | Anxiety | Clarity |
| System SOP | Repeatable doing | Repeatable thinking |

One tells you *when* to publish.
The other tells you *why*, *what*, and *how*.

Know the difference. Use both.

Exactly, with a well-defined content architecture, and consistent content calendar, we will see better results. What is your ratio between two? What is much important?
