## Original Post

Every time I fight AWS limits, I lose.
Every time I work with them, I win.

29s is the constraint to force us design FOR USERS. They aren't patient enough to wait up to that time 😅
  strategy: "Add perspective - reframe AWS constraint as user-centric design driver"

```

## Notes

- 29s refers to API Gateway timeout limit
- Comment reframes constraint as user experience benefit
- Good engagement on AWS architecture topic
