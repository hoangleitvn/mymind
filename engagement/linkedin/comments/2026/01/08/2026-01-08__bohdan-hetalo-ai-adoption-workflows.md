## Original Post

Perfect accuracy. Beautiful UI. No users. I've lost count of how many AI-powered features been built that looked amazing on paper, top-notch models, sleek interfaces, that "wow" factor. And yet… days or weeks later? Crickets. Why? AI alone doesn't solve problems. It's about matching capabilities to real user workflows, not just dropping the latest model into an app and hoping for adoption. One client spent a small fortune on a fraud detection tool that flagged almost every anomaly, but the team barely used it. Too many false alerts, poor integration with daily workflows, no adoption. We dug in, interviewed users, simplified alerts, connected the system to existing dashboards, and trained the team. Result? Usage jumped from 5% to 85% in two months. ROI followed. Lesson: AI adoption is 80% human connection, 20% tech. What's the biggest adoption challenge you've seen in AI projects? #AI #UserExperience #WorkflowDesign #TechAdoption #MachineLearning #HyggeSoftware

I agree Bohdan Hetalo, tech is nothing without workflow integration.

This is why chasing the latest AI tool is backwards. The tool didn't change in your example. The workflow and trust did.

Redesign workflow first. Build the human skills: problem framing, decomposition, evaluation, correction, systems thinking. Then let the tools follow.

## Notes

- Strong post with concrete example (fraud detection: 5% → 85%)
- Aligns with my embedded CTO experience - tool adoption is change management
- HyggeSoftware appears to be his consultancy
- Could be good connection target - similar audience (tech leaders dealing with AI integration)
- Low engagement (4 reactions) - early comment could get visibility
