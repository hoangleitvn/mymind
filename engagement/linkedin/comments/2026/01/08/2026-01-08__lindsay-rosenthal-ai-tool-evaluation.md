## Original Post

don't fall for every shiny new tool! here's how to save time/$$ for the ones that actually matter: new AI tools launch every day. it's easy to chase trends + feel like you're falling behind. stop. start with a 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿. ask yourself three questions before adopting a tool: 𝟭. 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺? • if it's a novelty, skip it. • focus on tools that remove invisible labor or scale your output. 𝟮. 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄? • a tool is only valuable if your team can actually use it consistently. • check integrations, ease of adoption, and learning curve. 𝟯. 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝗺𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗽𝗹𝘆 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗱? • does it give more output, better decisions, or reclaimed time? • avoid tools that only make small tasks slightly faster. 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿: 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 → 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄 → 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁 use this as a mental checklist before trying every shiny new tool. your time is more valuable than hype!!

That "multiply vs speed" distinction hits different. so many tools are like "save 5 minutes on this task!!" But if the task only happens once a week... who cares?? the tools worth paying for are the ones that let you do 10x more of something that actually moves the needle. Everything else is just noise.

Also gotta add: if you can't explain to your team in under 2 minutes why you're adding a new tool, it's probably not solving a real problem lol. Been guilty of this so many times. saw something cool on twitter, signed up, used it twice, forgot about it. Now i literally have a "tool graveyard" doc to remind myself to stop doing that.

Most agencies don't have a tech problem, they have a focus problem. If a tool doesn't remove real friction in an existing workflow and create visible leverage, it just adds noise and costs. Boring tools used daily always outperform shiny tools used once.

We track tool adoption with a simple question: "Did this change what we build, or just how fast we type?"

Most tools fail the test. They optimize the typing. The ones worth keeping changed what was possible. One code review tool let us enforce patterns we couldn't before. That's the multiply vs speed difference.

## Notes

- Strong framework post with practical application
- Lindsay is active Gen Z voice on LinkedIn (41k followers)
- Her "tool graveyard" confession makes her relatable
- Aligns with my themes around tool evaluation and engineering leadership
- Eric's "boring tools" comment is excellent. Could engage there too.
