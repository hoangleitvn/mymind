## Original Post

Seeing how the people who built AI systems actually use them is refreshing. It's learning directly from the source: Andrej Karpathy, OpenAI co-founder, showing how LLMs fit into his daily work (a classic already). Boris Cherny the creator of Claude Code, walking through his own setup (new). What stands out to me: after learning the basics, the advantage isn't the tool or exotic usage... It's judgment, taste, and iteration. Links in comments.

Same pattern I see. The gap isn't prompts or shortcuts. It's knowing when to accept output and when to push back.

Judgment: knowing when AI is confidently wrong.
Taste: knowing what "good" looks like before you see the output.

These don't come from tool training. They come from iteration.

## Notes

- Pedro Vilhena: Portugal-based, smaller audience (1.6K followers)
- References Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator) and Karpathy
- Post aligns with my AI-assisted development experience
- Low engagement so far but quality topic
- First engagement with this person
- Theme connects to my "Developer Knowledge Graph" post but kept comment clean (no self-promo)
