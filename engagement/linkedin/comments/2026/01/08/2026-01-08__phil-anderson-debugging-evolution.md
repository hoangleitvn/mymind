## Original Post

I've been writing software since 1989. Debugging software in 1989 meant pressing Enter, hoping that it would work, and then looking for that one line of code that was messing everything up. It sometimes took us weeks to find the one line of code that was the problem. Often, it was hardware-related or environment-specific because the hardware and the environments were so hostile to the software. It was a crazy, intense skill. Debugging required patience and methodical thinking to look at what you were getting on your screen as an end result from the software and then determine what portion of the code may need to be changed. That's all changed. Today's tools are instantaneous. They provide feedback in real time and automated diagnostics. This is probably a great thing, since modern software is so much more complex than what we were writing in 1989. Even a simple SaaS can be 500,000 lines of code (LOC). A medium-sized website is a quarter million LOC. A website like Amazon is likely to be millions and millions of lines of code. Automated debugging programs are an amazing tool for the modern software developer. At the same time, just like artificial intelligence, it still requires a deep understanding of the intricacies of the software. You can't just look at the debugging program and say that's everything I need to know. You have to understand how the language works and actually do programming in order to debug programming.

The primary problem is the fact that something as simple as Amazon IS millions of lines of code. I've written an entire Digital Audio Workstation in 50,000 lines of code. It can be done. But it requires a different, bloat-free, no-frameworks, no-lego-bricks mindset.

Thoughtful perspective, especially the reminder that tools don't replace understanding. One question, though: why do we need to frame this as a comparison between 1989 and today? It sometimes feels like these contrasts imply a loss of skill, when in reality the nature of the skill has just shifted.

However, now when I write code, I let the IDE and LLM do most of the typing for me. Is it better or worse?....eh...I think that feeling of realizing an idea into a tangible thing is what matters most, it gets to the core of being human.

I was hired on the spot when I was in my interview and a dev burst in needing help debugging code. I asked "have you run the app with the debug compile to see what is happening?" when the person suggested writing print lines all over the code.

"It sometimes took us weeks to find the one line of code that was the problem" - this hits hard.

Been in the same situation, especially debugging production issues where you're guessing what the user did or what environment quirk caused it. 

The tools got better, but the understanding requirement didn't go away.

Same pattern with AI-assisted coding now. Generation is instant, validation still requires knowing what correct looks like.
