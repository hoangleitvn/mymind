## Original Post Summary

Mario Alves (CEO, economics degree, former investment banker) shares that he shipped a financial control tower and a Polymarket trading bot using AI coding tools (v0, Clawdbot, Claude Code). Trading bot lost money but he emphasizes the freedom to iterate without waiting on developers. Key message: "idea person" and "builder" are no longer separate roles.

## My Comment

The iteration loop is the real unlock. Build, test, adjust. No handoffs.

Curious: for the financial control tower, how do you know the numbers are right before the accountants rely on them?

## Connection to My Content

Relates to "The Accountability Shift" - verification gap when non-technical builders ship without understanding how to verify correctness. Financial calculations fail silently.
