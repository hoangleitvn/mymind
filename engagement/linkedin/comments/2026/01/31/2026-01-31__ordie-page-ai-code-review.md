## Original Post Summary

Ordie Page argues against requiring engineers to understand every line of AI-generated code. Instead, staff-level engineering should focus on "system-level clarity" across five dimensions: Intent, Constraints, Interfaces, Invariants, Failure modes.

Recommends cyclic approach: "Plan → Run → Observe → Tighten → Run again."

## My Comment

Our job isn't to memorize generated code. Our job is to observe AI behaviors and patterns and add guardrails and rules to make it more reliable.

The five dimensions (intent, constraints, interfaces, invariants, failure modes) are solid guardrails for agentic workflows.

Where I'd add: "system-level clarity" still needs someone who owns what ships.

Most teams adopt AI tools but skip the observation habit. The output sounds right, so they move on.

Who catches the subtle errors? Engineers who've hit that wall before. Experience becomes the filter, not code review.

Accountability moves up the stack, agreed. But someone still has to own the outcome when Plan → Run → Observe produces something that looks correct but isn't.
