## Original Post Summary

Jiquan Ngiam describes running his personal life through Claude Code with auto-logging. Key instruction: "Do NOT ask before logging" - Claude automatically captures tasks, notes, people, context without confirmation prompts. Uses markdown files (work.md, personal.md, home.md, people/ folder), git for version control, grep for searchability. Plain text over proprietary lock-in.

## My Comment

The "do not ask before logging" instruction changes everything. Most people add friction with confirmation prompts.

Plain text + git. Full control, full searchability, no lock-in.

## Connection to My Content

Similar to mymind workspace architecture. Validates the approach of context that compounds across sessions.
