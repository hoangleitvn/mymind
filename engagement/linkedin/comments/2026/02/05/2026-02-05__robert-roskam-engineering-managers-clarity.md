## Original Post

The best engineering managers aren't the smartest in the room. They're the clearest. And clarity comes down to communicating three things, over and over again:

Performance: How we're doing
- Say what's good and what's not good
- Point out success and admit failure
- Get specific about both

Goals: What we're working toward
- Talk about the short term and the long term
- Establish measurements and set targets
- Connect individual contributions to organizational priorities

Meaning: Why we're doing it
- Link daily tasks to the why
- Show the impact in the world
- Help the team connect their work back to something bigger

It's exceptionally hard to over communicate these three things. So do it until you think you've overdone it. And then do it once more.

Solid list, Robert. I'd add the exceptional ones also have precise, actionable feedback that makes the team better. Too much of a "passive referee" who's only good at communicating the "rules" is a fairly common pitfall.

I would also add a fourth to your list: Reality: What's actually happening - Skip the corporate speak - Name the elephants in the room - Say the quiet part out loud

Clarity is key, you are right. On top of that, I would add simple honesty and transparency in decisions. Lead by example. Walk the talk.

This connects to a principle we live by: clarity over speed. When clarity is present, teams move with confidence. When it's absent, speed creates waste.

Your three pillars are what make sustainable speed possible. Without them, moving fast just compounds mistakes.
  strategy: "Add Context - Connect his clarity framework to our 'clarity over speed' principle"

## Notes

- Third engagement with Robert (previous: Claude Code memory drift, containers aging)
- Theme aligns with my clarity-over-speed content
- Comments adding extensions (Reality, actionable feedback, honesty) show engaged audience
- Good opportunity to reinforce relationship with substantive comment
