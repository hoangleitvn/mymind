## Original Post

Dear junior developers, stop racing to write code. (you'll thank me later)

I see it all the time: new devs think speed equals skill. They jump straight into coding and hope it works.

Here is the hard truth:
> writing code quickly doesn't make you better; it often makes you worse.

The secret is simple:
> understand the problem first.

Treat coding like the final step in a decision-making process, not the starting point.

Here's a framework that works:

1️⃣ Research the problem
↳ Don't skim the brief or assume you know it.
↳ Dig in, understand the context, constraints, and requirements.

2️⃣ List all possible solutions
↳ Brainstorm without judging.
↳ Even solutions that seem weird at first can lead to the best outcome.

3️⃣ Evaluate trade-offs
↳ Every solution has pros and cons.
↳ Consider performance, maintainability, scalability, and team impact.

4️⃣ Choose the best approach
↳ Make a confident decision based on evidence, not gut feel.
↳ Clarity here will save hours or days later.

5️⃣ Write the code
↳ Only now you should hit the keyboard.
↳ Because a well-planned solution is faster to implement and much less frustrating to debug.

💡 Remember:
> Quick coding is tempting.
> But in the long run, slow thinking beats fast typing every single time.

If you want to grow as a developer, start thinking like a problem-solver first. Coding comes second.

Which step do you skip most often?

We as software engineers are paid for solving business problems. And not for writing code. Code is just a tool to solve these problems. As middle developer, I measured my value by lines of code, features, bugs resolved. When I became a senior - I realized: No business cares about how elegant your code is if it doesn't solve their problem.

I've seen way more time wasted fixing "fast" code than writing slow, thought-out code. My take: pausing to think is a senior skill.

This is why senior engineers seem "slower" at first they're doing the thinking upfront.

A common challenge for junior Developers is that they aren't given the time to investigate a problem thoroughly. Instead, they are pressured to find an immediate solution or to escalate the incident. This often happens when the manager doesn't grasp the technical aspects.

I've seen seniors do this too. Years of experience doesn't automatically build the clarity muscle. They skip the questions, jump straight to "how", and ship solutions more complex than needed.

Clarity over speed. The simplest solution comes from the questions you didn't skip.
  strategy: "Add Context - Extend beyond juniors, connect skipping questions to complexity, tie to clarity principle"

## Notes

- Second engagement with Petar (first was humor post)
- This is substantive content, not humor - matches our themes
- Strong alignment with my "10 questions before building" post
- Good comments to engage with (Raul's "senior skill" line is quotable)
- High visibility post (142 reactions)
