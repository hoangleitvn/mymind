## Original Post

It's the time of the year for performance reviews. Every year, I remind myself that giving feedback comes down to this: "radical candor" plus "radical compassion." If you are too candid/direct, you will make your team feel defensive. But if you soften your feedback too much (which I have seen too many leaders do), your message will not be clear. The net effect if you don't get the balance right is that your team will not grow. It's a difficult balance to strike. We've all had moments where we've held back the feedback we planned to give because we don't want to hurt someone's feelings. But the truth is, when you deliver feedback from a place of wanting to help someone reach their potential, that actually builds trust. I always start there - I make sure that my team knows that I am deeply committed to their growth. So this performance review season, don't be afraid to be direct. But remember: being direct does not mean being harsh. Show the person you care about their growth and then follow it up with a plan to help them develop. "Radical candor" plus "radical compassion" is the feedback formula that works! What mindset are you taking into this performance review season?

Just finished my year-end reviews today. The balance is real.

Too direct and the team gets defensive. Too soft and they leave confused about where they actually stand. I've made both mistakes.

What works for me: share what I'm thinking, share the mindset behind it, then plan together. Reviews work best when it's a conversation about growth, not a verdict.
