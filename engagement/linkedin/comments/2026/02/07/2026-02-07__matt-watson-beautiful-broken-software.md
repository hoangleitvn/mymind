## Original Post

I've never seen so much absolutely beautiful software. None of it actually works. But it looks Lovable. Like someone needs to adopt it, and fix it. Users want dependable software, not Lovable software.

To me, this new vibe-coding craze is not much different than all the drag-and-drop software builders we've been struggling with over the past 3 decades. Yes, you can use them to build software, but it still requires someone with solid knowledge of actual coding to build something that's stable.

Yep, just like photoshop gave everyone access to typography. It's never the tool, it's the skill that matters.

We see this regularly. Founders show up with a polished demo built in a day. Then we look under the hood: no error handling, no edge cases, state management held together with hope.

The demo gets them excited. The rebuild gets them to actual users.
  strategy: "Add Context - share real pattern from working with founders, reinforces dependability point"
