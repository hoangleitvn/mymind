# Design Principles

> Everyone ships fast. Few build to last.

Five foundational beliefs that guide every design decision.

## Core Identity

**Mood**: Grounded, confident, substantial
**Inspired By**: Engineering documentation, architectural blueprints, academic publishing
**Best For**: Technical content, thought leadership, long-form analysis

## The Five Principles

### P1. Depth Over Surface

What you see should suggest what's beneath.

The iceberg metaphor: 20% visible, 80% foundation. Design should communicate that there's more substance than surface.

### P2. Clarity Over Cleverness

Understanding beats impressiveness.

If someone has to think about the design, it failed. The design should be invisible, letting content communicate.

### P3. Restraint Over Abundance

Less, but intentional.

Every element earns its place. Decoration without purpose is noise.

### P4. Grounded Over Floating

Weight and stability over lightness.

Design should feel anchored, substantial, built on solid ground. Not airy, not trendy, not ephemeral.

### P5. Timeless Over Trendy

Built to last, not built for now.

Avoid design patterns that will date quickly. Classic over fashionable.

## Principle Hierarchy

```
P1. Depth Over Surface     → Primary (defines brand identity)
P2. Clarity Over Cleverness → Secondary (ensures usability)
P3. Restraint Over Abundance → Tertiary (enforces discipline)
P4. Grounded Over Floating  → Supporting (visual weight)
P5. Timeless Over Trendy    → Supporting (longevity)
```

When principles conflict, higher-ranked principles take precedence.

## Validation Checklist

Use this to validate any design decision:

- [ ] **P1. Depth Over Surface** - Does it suggest more beneath?
- [ ] **P2. Clarity Over Cleverness** - Is it immediately understandable?
- [ ] **P3. Restraint Over Abundance** - Does every element earn its place?
- [ ] **P4. Grounded Over Floating** - Does it feel anchored and stable?
- [ ] **P5. Timeless Over Trendy** - Will it still work in 5 years?

If any answer is "no," reconsider the design.

## Visual Essence

How BTL should feel.

### Space and Form

- **Generous whitespace** - Breathing room communicates confidence
- **Geometric forms** - Sharp, precise, engineered
- **Clean edges** - No blur, no glow, no gradients (except allowed jade gradients)
- **Bottom-weighted** - Designs feel anchored, not floating

### Color and Material

- **Two-color discipline** - Jade and Charcoal only
- **Matte, not glossy** - Flat colors, no shine
- **High contrast** - Clear separation between elements
- **Dark mode native** - Designed for dark first, adapts to light

### Scale and Rhythm

- **Dramatic type scale** - Large headlines, clear hierarchy
- **8px rhythm** - All spacing on the grid
- **Consistent intervals** - Predictable spacing creates trust

### Typography as Element

- **Headlines carry weight** - Bold, confident, anchoring
- **Body recedes** - Readable but not competing
- **Minimal text** - Say more with less
- **No decorative type** - Function over form

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

- Use the accent bar consistently
- Anchor designs to the bottom
- Leave generous whitespace
- Test the squint test
- Use the iceberg mark at appropriate sizes
- Follow the two-color discipline

### Don't

- Add decorative elements without purpose
- Use more than 2 font weights per component
- Float designs (no center-vertical-only layouts)
- Use forbidden colors (purple, pink, blue, etc.)
- Sacrifice readability for style
- Follow design trends
