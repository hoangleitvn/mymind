## Public Sans vs Open Sans. What is actually different

They look similar at first glance, but they were designed for **very different jobs**.

---

## Origin and intent

### Public Sans
- Created by the **US Digital Service**
- Designed for **government and public-sector websites**
- Goal: maximum clarity, accessibility, and neutrality
- Built to be boring in the best way

### Open Sans
- Designed by **Steve Matteson** for Google
- Created during early web-font adoption
- Goal: friendly, flexible, general-purpose web font
- Optimized for wide adoption, not strict systems

---

## Visual and structural differences

### 1. Letterforms

**Public Sans**
- More restrained shapes
- Straighter strokes
- Less personality
- Feels institutional and calm

**Open Sans**
- Softer curves
- Slightly rounded terminals
- More “human” feel
- Feels friendlier, more informal

---

### 2. x-height and proportions

**Public Sans**
- Balanced x-height
- More vertical rhythm
- Easier to scan in long text

**Open Sans**
- Large x-height
- Text looks bigger at the same size
- Can feel dense in long paragraphs

---

### 3. Spacing and rhythm

**Public Sans**
- More even spacing
- Predictable word shapes
- Strong line rhythm

**Open Sans**
- Looser feel
- Slightly uneven rhythm in long-form UI
- Can look “blobby” at small sizes

---

## Screen readability

### Small sizes (UI, dense dashboards)

- **Public Sans** wins
- Cleaner counters
- Better differentiation between similar glyphs
- Less visual noise

### Medium sizes (marketing pages, blogs)

- **Open Sans** is fine
- Slightly more warmth
- Less rigid feel

---

## Accessibility and compliance

**Public Sans**
- Designed with accessibility as a first-class constraint
- Performs well with:
  - Low vision users
  - High-contrast modes
  - Long reading sessions
- Excellent for regulated environments

**Open Sans**
- Accessible, but not purpose-built for compliance-heavy systems
- More dependent on good size and line-height choices

---

## Unicode and language support

Both:
- Have broad Unicode coverage
- Support Vietnamese well
- Render diacritics cleanly

Public Sans has slightly more consistent diacritic spacing across weights.

---

## Performance and modern usage

**Public Sans**
- Fewer weights
- Encourages discipline
- Often self-hosted
- Common in serious SaaS, govtech, fintech

**Open Sans**
- Many weights and styles
- Often overused
- Frequently loaded via Google Fonts
- Strong “2015–2020 web” association

---

## Perception and brand signal

**Public Sans**
- Trustworthy
- Neutral
- Serious
- Infrastructure-first

**Open Sans**
- Friendly
- Generic
- Familiar
- Content-first

This perception matters more than people admit.

---

## When to choose each

### Choose Public Sans if:
- You build dashboards, admin panels, docs
- You care about clarity over personality
- You want typography to disappear
- You operate in regulated or global environments

### Choose Open Sans if:
- You want something safe and friendly
- Branding is light
- Typography is not a differentiator
- You accept a generic web feel

---

## Bottom line

**Public Sans is a system font.**  
**Open Sans is a content font.**

They overlap visually, but not philosophically.

If you are building software that must scale, endure, and remain legible under stress, **Public Sans is the better choice**.

If you are publishing content and want approachability without thinking too hard, **Open Sans is fine**.
