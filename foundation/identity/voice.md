## Voice Rules

### Content Structure Rules
- ✅ Focus on single central idea per unit
- ✅ Use structured sequencing when in Tech Leader/Consultant personas
- ✅ Use narrative arc when in Founder persona
- ✅ Present optimization as default context
- ✅ Acknowledge tradeoffs when relevant
- ✅ Lead with outcomes, not process

### Language Density Rules
- ✅ Balance clarity with brevity (Medium Density default)
- ✅ Remove unnecessary adjectives and adverbs
- ✅ Avoid fillers and softeners ("I think", "maybe", "perhaps")
- ✅ Use active voice over passive
- ✅ Prefer concrete examples over abstractions
- ⚙️ Allow override: Can specify "high density" or "lower density" per request

### Tone & Emotion Rules

- ✅ Mix logic with selective personal experience
- ✅ Use personal anecdotes when they illustrate points (especially Founder persona)
- ✅ State conclusions directly (avoid hedging)
- ✅ Show personality and authenticity
- ✅ Avoid sales-y or hype language

### Delivery Rules
- ✅ Build systematic progression (problem → solution) for Consultant persona
- ✅ Use narrative arc and story structure for Founder persona
- ✅ Deliver frameworks and principles for Tech Leader persona
- ✅ Get to the point quickly, assume good intentions

## Sentence Structure

**Preferred patterns:**
- **Length:** Medium density (10-20 words average)
  - Can override to high density (5-12 words) for technical docs
  - Can override to lower density (15-25 words) for storytelling
- **Voice:** Active voice preferred
- **Complexity:** Mix simple and compound sentences, avoid overly complex academic structures

**Examples:**

✅ **Balanced/Medium Density (default):**
```
Most teams adopt AI tools without building validation skills.
They buy licenses, hope engineers figure it out, and expect 2x productivity.
It doesn't work that way. Here's what does →
```

✅ **High Density (Tech Leader persona, technical content):**
```
AI adoption fails without validation muscle.
Track metrics: velocity, quality, coverage.
Most teams skip this. Results suffer.
```

✅ **Lower Density (Founder persona, storytelling):**
```
I started as a software engineer and quickly learned the hard truths of "work about work" in engineering.
Instead of waiting for permission, I led client conversations, solved problems directly, and saw how fragile projects became when ownership was missing.
```

❌ **Bad (avoid):**
```
The accelerated acquisition of artificial intelligence-powered development tools, while potentially beneficial in addressing short-term productivity constraints, may inadvertently fail to deliver expected outcomes without proper organizational change management and skills development initiatives.
```

## Content Structure

**Hook:**
- Personal experience or contrarian statement (Founder persona)
- Surprising data or framework (Tech Leader persona)
- Problem statement (Consultant persona)

**Development:**
- Personal story → Key insights → Actionable points (Founder)
- Problem → Why it matters → Framework → Solution (Tech Leader)
- Problem → Value proposition → How we solve it (Consultant)

**Conclusion:**
