# Angle: Ugly but Working > Perfect but Invisible

**Theme:** Practical Engineering

## Position

Working code that ships beats perfect code that doesn't. Perfectionism kills momentum and prevents validation. Ship ugly working solutions, learn from users, refine based on real usage. Perfect architecture for wrong product = expensive failure. Ugly solution for right product = foundation for success.

## Sharp Pillars

- Shipping working code > perfecting invisible code
- Users judge by working features, not code elegance
- Ugly code can be refactored; perfect code for wrong product cannot
- Perfectionism is procrastination disguised as professionalism

## Signature Proof

Ugly MVP shipping in 6 weeks validates product, captures market. Perfect solution shipping in 6 months arrives to market already captured. Ugliness is temporary and fixable; missed market timing is permanent.

## When To Use

- MVP vs perfect product debates
- Perfectionism paralysis
- Technical debt discussions
- Refactor vs ship decisions
- Code review perfectionism

## Tone

Direct. Anti-perfectionism. Shipping-focused.
