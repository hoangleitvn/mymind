# Angle: Quality at Fraction of Cost

**Theme:** Cost-Effective Development

## Position

Cost-effective development means quality output at sustainable prices, not cheap work that requires rewrites. Wrong model (hourly billing, no ownership) produces cheap and broken. Right model (embedded ownership, accountability) produces quality at 50-60% cost reduction. Quality + cost efficiency both achievable.

## Sharp Pillars

- Cost-effective ≠ cheap (quality maintained, price optimized)
- Traditional outsourcing: cheap rates, expensive rewrites
- Embedded ownership: sustainable rates, quality output
- Accountability matters more than hourly rate

## Signature Proof

Cheap offshore team: $25/hour × 2,000 hours = $50K → 6 months rewrite = $100K total. Quality team: $50/hour × 1,000 hours = $50K → ships correctly, no rewrites. Same initial cost, 2x difference in true cost.

## When To Use

- Cost vs quality tradeoff discussions
- Offshore development evaluation
- Budget optimization
- Quality concerns about cost reduction
- Vendor selection criteria

## Tone

Value-focused. Anti-cheap. Quality-driven.
