# Angle: Do More With Less

**Theme:** Cost-Effective Development

## Position

Small, high-bar teams outperform large average teams on speed, cost, and quality. Capital efficiency = strategic advantage. 5 exceptional engineers ship faster than 25 mediocre ones at 1/5 the cost. Focus on capability density, not headcount growth.

## Sharp Pillars

- Quality compounds; headcount fragments
- 5 A-players > 25 B-players in output, cost, and coordination
- Capital efficiency extends runway, reduces dilution
- Small teams force clarity and eliminate waste

## Signature Proof

25-person team: $4M annual burn, 300 communication paths, slow decisions. 5-person high-bar team: $800K burn, 10 communication paths, fast execution. 5x cost reduction, 10x coordination simplification, same or better output.

## When To Use

- Hiring strategy decisions
- Burn rate optimization
- Team scaling discussions
- Capital efficiency prioritization
- Startup runway extension

## Tone

Data-driven. Contrarian. Capital-focused.
