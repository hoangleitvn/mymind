# Angle: Accountability Over Hourly Excuses

**Theme:** Outsourcing 2.0

## Position

Traditional outsourcing fails because hourly billing creates misaligned incentives: vendor profits from logging hours, not delivering outcomes. "I founded INNOMIZE with one goal: build with accountability, not hourly excuses." Success = delivered product, not logged hours. This fundamental shift changes everything.

## Sharp Pillars

- Hourly billing: vendor incentive = log more hours; client want = ship faster (fundamental conflict)
- Every efficiency improvement in hourly model hurts vendor revenue
- Accountability model: vendor profits from delivering value, not logging time
- Trust builds through delivery, not contracts and hour tracking (less "work about work")

## Signature Proof

INNOMIZE founding principle (2018): Accountability not excuses. Traditional outsourcing #1 complaint = misaligned incentives, hour billing. Client feedback: "No more arguing about hours, just shipping products."

**Pattern:** Hourly vendor estimates "300-500 hours" → takes 500, every question = "out of scope" vs. accountability model → "Feature ships next week, we own it end-to-end."

## When To Use

- Differentiating INNOMIZE from traditional outsourcing
- INNOMIZE founding story
- "Why trust offshore team?" objections
- Explaining misaligned incentive problem
- Core positioning conversations

## Tone

Direct. Challenging traditional model. Personal (INNOMIZE founding). Principled (misaligned incentives).
