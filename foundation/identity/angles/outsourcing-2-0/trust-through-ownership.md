# Angle: Trust Through Ownership

**Theme:** Outsourcing 2.0

## Position

Trust comes from ownership and accountability, not contracts and hourly rates. Vendor relationship = transactional, minimizing effort per dollar. Partner relationship = invested in success, owning outcomes. Outsourcing 2.0 builds trust through demonstrated ownership and aligned incentives.

## Sharp Pillars

- Vendor mindset: maximize billable hours, minimize accountability
- Partner mindset: optimize for outcomes, own successes and failures
- Trust built through action: fixing problems without billing disputes
- Aligned incentives: partner wins when product succeeds

## Signature Proof

Vendor finds critical bug: "That's out of scope, needs new contract." Partner finds critical bug: fixes immediately, discusses scope after. Trust comes from ownership behavior, not contractual language.

## When To Use

- Vendor vs partner evaluation
- Trust issues with current outsourcing
- Relationship model selection
- Incentive alignment discussions
- Long-term partnership building

## Tone

Relationship-focused. Trust-driven. Accountability-oriented.
