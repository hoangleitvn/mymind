# Angle: From Zero to Live Users

**Theme:** Outsourcing 2.0

## Position

Outsourcing 2.0 owns the complete journey from idea to live users, not just code delivery. Traditional model stops at "code deployed." Embedded ownership model ensures product reaches users, solves problems, delivers business value. End-to-end accountability for outcomes, not tasks.

## Sharp Pillars

- Traditional outsourcing: deliver code, declare victory
- Outsourcing 2.0: deliver working product with live users
- Accountability extends from architecture → deployment → user adoption
- Success measured by business outcomes, not story points completed

## Signature Proof

Traditional vendor: ships code, 40% adoption, declares done. Embedded ownership: refines until 70% adoption, optimizes performance, owns outcome. Same initial code, different accountability model, 75% difference in actual value delivered.

## When To Use

- Outsourcing vendor evaluation
- Accountability expectations setting
- Success metrics definition
- Full-service vs delivery-only choice
- Product ownership discussions

## Tone

Outcome-focused. Accountability-driven. Results-oriented.
