# Angle: Build Things That Last

**Theme:** Technical Architecture & Foundations

## Position

Strong foundations enable 10x growth without rewrites. Foundation-first approach invests 10% upfront to prevent 6-month rebuilds later. Not over-engineering — strategic scaffolding that won't break under scale while allowing fast iteration on business logic.

## Sharp Pillars

- 2-3 weeks foundation work prevents 6+ months rebuilds
- Foundation ≠ over-engineering (10% structure, 90% business logic)
- Technical debt compounds like financial debt
- "Make it future person's problem" = expensive lesson later

## Signature Proof

Startup ships MVP in 6 weeks with no foundation → rewrites at 10K users (3 months lost). Startup invests 2 weeks in foundation → scales to 100K users without rebuild. Foundation cost: 2 weeks. Rebuild cost: 12 weeks + lost momentum.

## When To Use

- MVP architecture decisions
- Technical debt prioritization
- Scaling preparation
- Platform vs feature choices
- Build vs buy evaluations

## Tone

Pragmatic. Long-term focused. Anti-shortcuts.
