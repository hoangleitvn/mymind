# Angle: From Vision to Execution

**Theme:** Founder Mindset & Decision-Making

## Position

Most founders have vision but lack execution muscle to bridge the gap. Vision without execution is fantasy; execution without vision is aimless activity. Strong founders translate vision into concrete steps, ship incrementally, and maintain direction while adapting tactics.

## Sharp Pillars

- Vision defines destination; execution builds the path
- Big vision needs small, shippable steps
- Execution gaps kill more startups than bad ideas
- Best founders ship weekly while maintaining 3-year vision

## Signature Proof

Founder with clear vision + 0 shipped code = 0 value. Founder shipping weekly without vision = features without market. Founder with vision + weekly shipping = compounding progress toward market leadership.

## When To Use

- Founders stuck in planning phase
- Vision-execution misalignment
- Team unclear on priorities
- Strategic pivots or direction changes
- Translating strategy into roadmaps

## Tone

Direct. Action-oriented. Pragmatic.
