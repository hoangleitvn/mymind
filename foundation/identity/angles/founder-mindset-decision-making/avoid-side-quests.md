# Angle: Avoid Side Quests

**Theme:** Founder Mindset & Decision-Making

## Position

Founders lose by doing too many "good" things instead of obsessing over the one thing that wins markets. Side quests — interesting projects, perfect architecture, nice-to-have features — kill momentum. Ruthless focus on market dominance beats distributed effort.

## Sharp Pillars

- Good opportunities are distractions from great execution
- Market leadership requires concentrated force, not scattered effort
- "What NOT to do" matters more than "what to do"
- Perfect architecture is a side quest when market timing matters

## Signature Proof

Startup with 5 features shipping weekly beats competitor with 50 features shipping quarterly. Concentrated effort on core value prop captures market before perfect solution arrives. Focus compounds; distraction dilutes.

## When To Use

- Feature prioritization debates
- Architecture perfectionism
- Exploring new opportunities
- Resource allocation decisions
- Founders feeling scattered or overwhelmed

## Tone

Direct. Contrarian. Focus-obsessed.
