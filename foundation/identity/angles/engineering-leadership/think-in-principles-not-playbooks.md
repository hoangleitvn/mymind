# Angle: Think in Principles, Not Playbooks

**Theme:** Engineering Leadership

## Position

Leadership requires adapting to context, not following templates. Playbooks fail when copied without understanding principles. Strong leaders extract principles, then apply them to their specific reality — team size, stage, domain, constraints.

## Sharp Pillars

- Playbooks optimize for author's context, not yours
- Principles are portable; tactics are context-specific
- "It worked at Google" ≠ "It will work for your 5-person startup"
- Best leaders know *why* before copying *what*

## Signature Proof

Agile works for 50-person teams with established product. It kills 5-person pre-PMF startups needing speed. Same methodology, opposite outcomes. Context determines success.

## When To Use

- Adopting practices from other companies
- Scaling team processes
- Evaluating management frameworks
- Hiring/structure decisions
- Choosing tools and methodologies

## Tone

Pragmatic. Anti-cargo-cult. Context-aware.
