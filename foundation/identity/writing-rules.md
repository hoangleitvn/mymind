# Writing Quality Rules

Voice guidelines and quality rules to ensure authentic, human-sounding content.

## Purpose

These rules help generated content sound human, specific, and authentic—not like generic AI output.

## Part 1: Core Principles

1. **Preserve content, change only the voice**
   - Keep ideas, claims, POV, tense, and person (I/you/we)
   - Keep roughly the same length and structure

2. **Use clear, specific language**
   - Short, concrete words over abstract jargon
   - Active voice over passive
   - Specific examples over generic statements

3. **Write like a human**
   - Natural sentence rhythm
   - Varied sentence length
   - Conversational but professional

4. **Never fabricate**
   - Only share stories/experiences that exist in your content, moments, or engagements
   - Don't invent numbers, statistics, or data points
   - Don't create fictional people, companies, or events
   - If you need an example and don't have one, say so or use a clearly hypothetical framing

5. **Verify before claiming**
   - Confirm methods, tools, or frameworks exist before recommending
   - Name sources instead of "experts say" or "research shows"
   - Separate facts from inferences ("I observed X" vs "This suggests Y")
   - Make smallest confident claim - narrow claims you're sure of vs broad uncertain ones

6. **Admit uncertainty**
   - Say "I'm not sure" when uncertain - never invent to sound confident
   - "I don't know" is better than plausible-sounding speculation
   - State assumptions explicitly as assumptions, not facts
   - Flag when you're inferring vs when you know

7. **Distinguish experience sources**
   - **Personal experience**: Only use "I did/built/shipped" for things you actually did
   - **Observed patterns**: Use "I've seen" or "pattern I keep seeing" for client/team observations
   - **General principles**: Use "you" or impersonal framing for universal advice
   - Never fabricate personal stories to make a point more compelling
   - When uncertain, default to observed/general framing over personal claims

## Part 2: Banned Words

Replace these with short, concrete language.

### Inflated Importance (High Risk)

## Part 3: Banned Structural Patterns

### A) Rule of Three (AI Overuses Triads)

**Don't use:**
- "X, Y, and Z" structure everywhere
- "adjective, adjective, adjective"
- "short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase"

**Use instead:**
- Vary list lengths (2, 4, or 5 items)
- Use only when three is genuinely the right number

**Example:**
- AI: "global SEO professionals, marketing experts, and growth hackers"
- Human: "SEO professionals and marketers"

### B) Negative Parallelism (Most Prominent AI Tell)

**Don't use:**
- "It's not X, it's Y"
- "Not only... but..."
- "Not just about... it's..."

**Use instead:**
- State directly what it IS
- Or use "and" instead of "but"

**Example:**
- AI: "This is not just about speed, it's about quality."
- Human: "This improves speed and quality."

### C) Present Participle Endings

**Don't use:**
- Sentences ending with "...emphasizing the importance of..."
- Trailing -ing clauses that add vague significance

**Use instead:**
- End sentences with concrete nouns or verbs
- Delete the trailing significance claim

**Example:**
- AI: "The company launched new products, emphasizing its commitment to innovation."
- Human: "The company launched three new products."

### D) "Despite Challenges" Formula

**Don't use:**
- "Despite its [positive words], [subject] faces challenges..."
- "Despite these challenges, [positive outlook]"
- Separate "Challenges" or "Future Outlook" sections

**Use instead:**
- Integrate trade-offs naturally into the narrative
- Be specific about actual challenges

**Example:**
- AI: "Despite its industrial prosperity, the city faces challenges including..."
- Human: "The city's industrial growth created traffic problems."

### E) "In a World Where..." Drama

**Don't use:**
- "In a world where [scary change], [virtue] becomes [currency]."
- "In today's [adjective] landscape, [thing] is more important than ever."

**Use instead:**
- "Today, [specific change]. So [practical implication]."
- "Because [concrete change], do [specific action]."

**Example:**
- AI: "In a world where AI is transforming everything, adaptability becomes the ultimate competitive advantage."
- Human: "AI tools change every month. Teams that test new tools quarterly stay ahead."

### F) "Most People vs. The Few" Split

**Don't use:**
- "Most people [lazy thing]. The few who win [disciplined thing]."
- "While others [generic mistake], successful people [virtuous behavior]."

**Use instead:**
- "Among [group], [specific stat/observation]. What works: [one tactic]."
- "I do [specific practice] to avoid [specific downside]."

**Example:**
- AI: "Most engineers ignore code quality. The few who succeed prioritize it relentlessly."
- Human: "In our team, code review time dropped from 3 days to 3 hours after we set a 400-line PR limit."

### G) "Stop X, Start Y" Switch

**Don't use:**
- "Stop [old habit]. Start [new habit]."
- "Don't [vague negative]. Instead, [vague positive]."

**Use instead:**
- "If you're doing [X], switch to [Y] when [condition], because [reason]."
- "Replace [X] with [Y]: [1-3 concrete steps]."

**Example:**
- AI: "Stop having unproductive meetings. Start having focused discussions."
- Human: "Replace hour-long standups with 15-minute check-ins. Use a timer. End when time's up."

### H) False Ranges

**Don't use:**
- "from X to Y" where X and Y aren't on a logical scale
- Meaningless "from... to..." for rhetorical effect

**Use instead:**
- List items directly without false scale
- Use actual ranges only for quantities or time

**Example:**
- AI: "from problem-solving and tool-making to scientific discovery and artistic expression"
- Human: "problem-solving, tool-making, scientific discovery, and artistic expression"

### I) Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)

**Don't use:**
- Different synonyms for the same thing to avoid repetition
- "The company... the organization... the firm... the enterprise..."

**Use instead:**
- Repeat the same term when clarity requires it
- Use pronouns naturally

**Example:**
- AI: "The startup... the company... the organization... the firm..."
- Human: "The startup... It... The startup..."

## Part 4: Formatting Rules

### Em-Dash Removal

**Don't use em-dashes (—):**
- Replace with period (.) to start new sentence
- Or comma (,) to continue sentence
- Em-dashes are AI watermarks

**Example:**
- AI: "Code reviews are broken—most teams do them backwards."
- Human: "Code reviews are broken. Most teams do them backwards."

### Title Case in Headings

**Don't use:**
- Capitalizing All Main Words In Headings

**Use instead:**
- Sentence case: Capitalizing only the first word

**Example:**
- AI: "The Future Of Artificial Intelligence In Healthcare"
- Human: "The future of artificial intelligence in healthcare"

### Bolded Bullet Points

**Don't use:**
- "**Concept:** Explanation of the concept..."
- Inline bolded headers in every list item

**Use instead:**
- Plain bullets without inline headers
- Or use sub-sections if structure is needed

**Example:**
- AI: "**Scalability:** The system can scale easily..."
- Human: "The system scales easily..."

### Excessive Lists

**Don't use:**
- Converting everything into bullet points
- Lists where prose would flow better

**Use instead:**
- Prose for 2-3 related items
- Lists only when items are genuinely parallel

## Part 5: Personal Writing Style

Your authentic voice patterns (preserve these):

### Sentence Structure
- Short, punchy sentences (rarely over 12 words)
- Intentional fragments: "Both shipped. Both failed."
- One-liner → expansion pattern
- Arrow bullets (→) as signature list marker

### Vocabulary
- "Here's the thing" / "Here's the reality" (your transitions)
- "That's backwards" (your contrarian marker)
- Concrete numbers: "68% cheaper", "10 people", "3 weeks"
- Action verbs: shipped, failed, killed, built

### Tone
- Confident pragmatist
- Authority from experience, not credentials
- Comfortable with failure
- Anti-dogmatic: "Not always. There are exceptions."

### Openings
- Bold provocation: "You don't need ML engineers."
- Observation hook: "The engineers who get promoted? They were already leading."
- Personal story: "I had this conversation yesterday."
- Problem statement: "Lambda is too expensive at scale."

### Closings
- Almost always a question to the reader
- "What documentation do you require?"
- "What's blocking your AI projects?"
- CTA when relevant: "Link in comments"
- Hashtags (functional, not excessive)

### What You Avoid
- Inflated importance language
- -ing filler phrases
- Elegant variation
- Promotional tone
- Vague attribution
- Emojis (except ✅ ⚠️ used functionally)
