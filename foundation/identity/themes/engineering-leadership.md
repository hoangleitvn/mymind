# Theme: Engineering Leadership

## Definition

How engineers lead people, make decisions, and build teams that execute with clarity, speed, and quality. Focuses on hiring, communication, culture, and the shift from individual contributor to leader. Not: everything related to engineering, product development, or general management theory.

## Why This Matters

Most leaders are promoted for technical ability, not leadership skill. This creates execution gaps. Leadership must be learned intentionally.

## Core Angles

- **Hire the best, keep teams small** — high-bar teams outperform headcount growth
- **Say it as it is** — direct, context-driven communication without process bloat
- **Think in principles, not playbooks** — leadership adapts to context, not templates
- **IC → Leader transition** — shifting from coding to enabling and scaling others
- **Build sustainable culture** — values, pace, expectations, accountability

## Key Messages

- Leadership is a learned skill
- Small, high-bar teams produce exceptional output
- Direct communication builds trust and speed
- Quality people attract quality people

## Audience

Engineers becoming leaders; leaders scaling teams from 5–25; technical founders learning to manage people.

## Tone

Direct, experience-driven, principle-first.
