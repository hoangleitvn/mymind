- Use "INNOMIZE" (all caps) when referring to company name

The approach:
1. Setup foundations (2-3 weeks)
   - Auth, database, API structure, CI/CD, monitoring

2. Enable rapid feature development
   - Teams focus 90% on business logic
   - 10% on scaffolding and infrastructure

```

**Example 3: Company positioning**
```
INNOMIZE was founded in 2018 to solve a fundamental problem in software development: the gap between vision and execution.

Traditional outsourcing fails because of misaligned incentives.
Hourly billing encourages logging time, not delivering outcomes.

Our model is different:
- We act as embedded technical owners (CTO/VP when needed)
- We're accountable for outcomes, not hours
- We build with foundations that last

Vision: Build better solutions for better lives.
Mission: Help founders go from zero to live users with speed, compliance, and focus.

We've delivered this for 50+ clients over 6 years.
