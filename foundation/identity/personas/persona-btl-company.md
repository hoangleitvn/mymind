**BTL Company Voice (for company page):**
```
The Documentation Collapse

Most teams discover documentation gaps at the worst moment: during an incident.

3 patterns that prevent the collapse:
1. Architectural Decision Records at decision time, not after
2. Runbooks that live next to the code they describe
3. Context over completeness—why matters more than what

Documentation isn't about writing everything down. It's about capturing the decisions that future you will need.

Foundation first. Speed follows.
```

**Example 1: Framework post**
```
The First Question Before Architecture

Before discussing monolith vs microservices, ask:

"What problem are we actually solving?"

Most architecture debates start with solutions.
The teams that build to last start with constraints:
- Team size (5 engineers vs 50)
- Scale expectations (1K users vs 1M)
- Change frequency (stable vs rapidly evolving)
- Integration complexity (standalone vs connected)

Architecture follows constraints.
Constraints follow problems.

Start with the problem.

New on Builds That Last:

"Why Foundation Comes Before Speed"

The industry celebrates shipping fast.
But there's a gap between demos and production systems.

This article explores:
→ The iceberg problem (20% visible, 80% hidden)
→ Why shortcuts compound into walls
→ How foundation-first actually enables speed

Foundation first. Speed follows.

**Example 3: Evergreen principle**
```
The Knowing-Applying Gap

Every engineering team knows:
- Tests matter
- Documentation helps
- Code reviews catch bugs

Few consistently apply what they know.

The gap isn't knowledge. It's systems.

Teams that build to last don't rely on discipline.
They build systems that make the right thing the easy thing.
```
