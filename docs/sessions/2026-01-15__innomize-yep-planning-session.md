# INNOMIZE Year-End Presentation Planning

## Summary

Developed theme and initial draft for INNOMIZE 2025 Year-End Review & 2026 Vision presentation. Settled on "Builder Mindset" theme with three pillars (OWN, BUILD, LEAD) based on strategic shift from consulting to solutions/products and addressing team mindset gaps identified in 1:1 conversations.

## Actions Completed

- Analyzed 2024 YEP structure and theme ("Autonomy & Sustainability")
- Identified 2026 strategic priorities: consulting→builder, vendor→partner, revenue efficiency, engineering excellence
- Developed "Builder Mindset" theme with Vietnamese tagline
- Created three pillars: OWN, BUILD, LEAD
- Drafted 17-slide presentation outline at `projects/innomize/2025-year-end-review-draft.md`
- Incorporated honest feedback from 1:1 observations (passive mindset, waiting for tasks, blaming)

## Why This Matters

- **Problem:** Team exhibits passive, task-waiting behavior; company needs to shift from consulting to solutions/products model
- **Solution:** "Builder Mindset" theme addresses both business model transformation AND individual mindset transformation
- **Benefits:** Unified message connecting company strategy (revenue without headcount) to individual growth (ownership, initiative)

## Pending Tasks

### Priority 1: Content to Add
- 2025 client achievements and highlights
- 2025 technology/innovation milestones
- Assessment of 2025 goals (INNOVATE, OPTIMIZE, EMPOWER)
- Specific 2026 metrics and targets

### Priority 2: Refinement
- Review slide 5 (honest conversation) for appropriate framing
- Add specific examples of builder vs task-taker behavior
- Consider visual elements/diagrams for pillars

### Priority 3: Delivery
- Prepare presenter notes and talking points
- Plan discussion/Q&A segments

## Recommendation

Next step: Fill in 2025 achievements (Slide 2) and specific 2026 goals (Slide 15) to complete the draft before visual design.
