# LinkedIn Posting Strategy 2026

Based on 2025 performance analysis across 86 published posts.

## 2025 Performance Summary

| Metric | Total |
|--------|-------|
| Impressions | 66,006 |
| Reactions | 617 |
| Comments | 150 |
| Reposts | 65 |
| Saves | 122 |
| Followers Gained | 93 |

## What Worked

### Top Performing Content Types
1. **List-based technical content** (5-10 signs/principles/rules)
   - "9 Signs Engineer Not Coder": 12,619 impressions
   - "10 Signs Using AI Right": 9,523 impressions
   - Average: 8,000+ impressions

2. **AWS/Cloud deep-dives**
   - Average: 4,923 impressions
   - Technical practitioners engage heavily

3. **Practical Engineering insights**
   - Average: 2,220 impressions
   - High save rate (long-term value)

### Best Posting Days
- **Wednesday**: 1,072 avg impressions
- **Saturday**: 1,753 avg impressions
- Posting time: 8-10am performs best

## What Didn't Work

### Underperforming Content Types
1. **Leadership philosophy** (without technical backing)
   - Average: 300-500 impressions
   - 15x lower than technical lists

2. **Werner Vogels keynote synthesis**
   - 331 impressions (too niche)
   - Lesson: Pure news/summary underperforms original insight

3. **AI bubble/snowball debate**
   - High comments (18) but low impressions
   - Controversy drives engagement but not reach

## 2026 Posting Cadence

**Frequency**: 1 post/day (not 2x/day)

### Weekly Schedule

| Day | Content Type | Format |
|-----|--------------|--------|
| Monday | Technical how-to | List-based (5-10 items) |
| Tuesday | AWS/Architecture | Deep-dive or comparison |
| Wednesday | Engineering principles | List-based (high performers) |
| Thursday | Cloud/DevOps | Technical insight |
| Friday | Practical lessons | Story + insight |
| Saturday | Personal story | Technical backing |
| Sunday | Rest or engagement-only | No new posts |

### Content Ratios
- **60%** List-based technical content (Mon/Wed/Fri)
- **30%** AWS/Architecture deep-dives (Tue/Thu)
- **10%** Personal stories with technical insight (Sat)

## Quality Over Quantity

### Why Not 2x/Day
1. Cannibalizes own reach (LinkedIn throttles)
2. Reduces engagement per post
3. Burns through high-quality topics faster
4. Audience fatigue

### Format Strategy
- **Lists** (5-10 items): Highest performance
- **Story + insight**: Medium performance, builds connection
- **Pure opinion**: Avoid unless backed by data
- **News/summary**: Skip (underperforms)

## Topic Pipeline Priority

### High Priority (Proven Performers)
- AI coding patterns (what works, what fails)
- Architecture decisions (monolith vs microservices)
- AWS cost optimization
- Engineering team practices
- "Signs you're..." format

### Medium Priority
- Platform engineering
- DevOps evolution
- Startup technical decisions

### Low Priority (Save for Engagement)
- Industry commentary
- Leadership philosophy (unless data-backed)
- Tool announcements

## Tracking

Update `performance_metrics` in frontmatter within 48-72 hours of posting.

Key metrics to watch:
- Impressions (reach)
- Reactions + Comments (engagement rate)
- Saves (long-term value indicator)
- Followers (conversion)
