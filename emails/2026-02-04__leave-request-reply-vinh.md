# Leave Request Reply - Vinh

**Subject:** Re: Leave Request - Approved

Hi Vinh,

We give employees flexibility to manage their own leave schedule, but that flexibility comes with responsibility to follow policy, planning ahead, and being mindful of peak periods like Lunar New Year when we already have long breaks.

I understand you have personal reasons for this request. At the same time, we need to respect everyone on the team equally. Our rule is simple: no more than 50% of employees can take leave on the same date. This keeps operations running and ensures fairness.

For this request, I'm approving your confirmed schedule below. But I want to be clear, this is a one-time exception.

Next time, please check our leave policy before submitting. It helps you plan better and avoids situations like this.

Thanks for your understanding.

Hoang
