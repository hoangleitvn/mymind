# LinkedIn Profile Audit: 2026-01-16

## Executive Summary

**Overall Score: 8/10** (slight decrease from 8.5/10)

Your profile is strong overall. The headline was updated with BTL and INNOMIZE positioning. Key finding: **About section hasn't been updated** to reflect the new dual-brand positioning (BTL + INNOMIZE) and is missing social proof (testimonials) despite having 6 strong recommendations.

**Key Changes Needed:**

| Priority | Action | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| High | Update About section with testimonials | High |
| High | Restructure Featured with BTL + INNOMIZE | High |
| Medium | Add BTL to headline more prominently | Medium |


## Current State vs. Framework

### Profile Journey Analysis

```
Content → Profile Click → Banner → Headshot → Headline → About → Featured → Follow
```

| Element | Current State | Framework Alignment | Score |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| Banner | "Few build to last" messaging | Good - aligns with BTL | 8/10 |
| Headline | "Founder @ INNOMIZE & Builds That Last \| Fractional CTO \| Cloud, DevSecOps, AI" | Clear role, but could be stronger | 7/10 |
| About | No testimonials, INNOMIZE-focused only, no BTL mention | Missing social proof, not dual-brand | 6/10 |
| Featured | INNOMIZE link + 2 posts | Missing BTL, posts keep on platform | 5/10 |
| Experience | BTL added as Founder & Author | Good | 8/10 |
| Recommendations | 6 strong client testimonials | Excellent | 9/10 |


## Section-by-Section Analysis

### 1. Headline (7/10) — Needs Refinement

**Current (220 chars max):**
> Founder @ INNOMIZE & Builds That Last | Fractional CTO | Cloud, DevSecOps, AI

**Character count:** ~77 (room for expansion)

**Issues:**
- "Builds That Last" buried after INNOMIZE
- No clear outcome or who you help
- "Cloud, DevSecOps, AI" is generic

**Recommended Headline Options:**

**Option A (Value-focused):**
```
Founder @ Builds That Last | Fractional CTO helping founders ship fast, scale safely | Building INNOMIZE (40+ engineers)
```
*Why:* Leads with BTL, clarifies value, shows scale

**Option B (Outcome-focused):**
```
Foundation-first engineering | Fractional CTO @ INNOMIZE | Founder @ Builds That Last | From zero to live users
```
*Why:* Philosophy upfront, both brands, clear outcome

**Option C (Curiosity-inducing):**
```
"Few build to last" | Fractional CTO @ INNOMIZE | Writing about engineering leadership @ Builds That Last
```
*Why:* Hook with tagline, clear dual-role positioning


### 2. About Section (6/10) — NEEDS UPDATE

**Current Issues:**

1. **No testimonials** — Framework recommends 3+ embedded testimonials
2. **No BTL mention** — Only INNOMIZE positioning
3. **No newsletter CTA** — Missing conversion path
4. **Character count:** ~1,650 (room for 950 more)

**Recommended About Section (PAS + Social Proof):**

```
Most founders get stuck between vision and execution.

They have the idea. They have the market insight. What they don't have is a technical leader who acts like an owner, not a vendor billing hours.

I founded INNOMIZE to solve this. I work as your Fractional CTO or VP of Engineering. Not staff augmentation. Not outsourcing with hourly excuses. Accountability-driven development that gets you from zero to live users.

What I bring:
→ 15+ years building engineering teams and products (startups and enterprise)
→ 50+ projects shipped: SaaS platforms, enterprise solutions, custom applications
→ A team of 40+ engineers in Vietnam delivering quality at 50-60% of US/EU rates
→ Foundation-first approach: 90% of your team's energy goes to business logic, not scaffolding

I also publish Builds That Last — an engineering leadership publication exploring what separates software that survives from software that collapses.

I work with:
• Technical founders stuck in planning who need to ship
• Non-technical co-founders who need a technical partner they can trust
• Early-stage companies (pre-product to Series A) who can't afford a full-time CTO

What clients say:

"Hoang combines strong technical expertise, execution rigor, and clear communication, making collaboration smooth and highly effective. A reliable, professional, and committed partner."
— Nicolas Feuillade, Co-Founder & CEO @ Ayruu

"Hoang and Innomize operate as true technical partners rather than transactional vendors. They take ownership of the work, care deeply about outcomes, and consistently deliver."
— Benjamin Elliott, CTO

"Hoang helped us at CaringUp as a fractional CTO. He knows his stuff well, delivers on his commitments, and takes initiative to identify areas we had missed."
— Pervaiz Gul, Founder

The goal is simple: speed to live users with quality that lasts.

If you're building something and need a technical owner (not just a team), let's talk.

```

**Character count:** ~2,180 (under 2,600 limit)

**Structure:**
- Hook: "Most founders get stuck..." (prompts "see more")
- Pain/Agitation: vendor vs. owner problem
- Solution: INNOMIZE + accountability model
- Expertise: quantified achievements
- BTL introduction: connects both brands
- Audience: clear who you help
- Social proof: 3 testimonials (shortened)
- CTA: newsletter link


### 3. Featured Section (5/10) — NEEDS RESTRUCTURING

**Current:**
| # | Type | Content |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | Link | INNOMIZE website |
| 2 | Post | "AI licenses 6 months ago..." (20 reactions) |
| 3 | Post | "Coding is typing..." (52 reactions) |

**Issues per Framework:**
1. **Missing BTL** — Your newsletter should be featured
2. **Posts keep people ON LinkedIn** — Framework says drive OFF platform
3. **No presentation/media** — You requested visual assets for BTL/INNOMIZE

**Recommended Featured Setup:**

| # | Type | Content | Why |
|---|------|---------|-----|
| 1 | Link | **Builds That Last** (Substack) | Primary conversion path |
| 2 | Link/PDF | **BTL Presentation** | Showcases thought leadership |
| 3 | Link | **INNOMIZE** (website) | Service offering |
| 4 | Link/PDF | **INNOMIZE Presentation** | Showcases capabilities |

**Limit to 2 for cleaner look:**
1. BTL Newsletter (primary)
2. INNOMIZE Website (secondary)


### 4. Banner (8/10) — Good, Minor Update

**Current:**
- "Everyone ships fast."
- "Few build to last." (red accent)
- "Building Teams That Build Things That Last"
- Subtext: "From zero to live users"

**Assessment:** Strong alignment with BTL brand. The messaging works.

**Minor Enhancement:**
- Consider adding `buildthatlast.substack.com` URL
- Or add both brands: "INNOMIZE • Builds That Last"


### 5. Experience (8/10) — Good

**BTL Entry (Verified):**
```
Founder & Author
Builds That Last
Jan 2026 - Present
Engineering leadership publication exploring what separates software that survives from software that collapses.
```

**Assessment:** Well-positioned. Experience section properly reflects dual-brand.


### 6. Recommendations (9/10) — Excellent

You have 6 strong recommendations from clients. This is a major strength. The issue is these aren't visible in the About section where most visitors read.


## Featured Section Media Requirements

You requested media for BTL and INNOMIZE as Featured items. Here's the plan:

### Option A: PDF One-Pagers (Recommended)

LinkedIn Featured accepts PDFs that display as thumbnails. Create:

**1. BTL One-Pager**
- Title: "Builds That Last: Engineering Leadership for the Long Game"

- Size: 1200×630px or standard Letter size
- CTA: "Visit innomizetech.com"


### Option B: Presentation Decks (More elaborate)

Create SlideShare or direct PDF presentations:

**BTL Presentation (5-7 slides):**
1. Cover: "Builds That Last" + tagline
2. The Problem: 80% iceberg metaphor
3. What We Cover: Topics/themes
4. Who It's For: Target audience
5. Subscribe CTA

**INNOMIZE Presentation (7-10 slides):**
1. Cover: INNOMIZE + positioning

4. What We Deliver: capabilities
5. Results: client outcomes (metrics)
6. Team: 40+ engineers in Vietnam
7. Testimonials: 2-3 quotes
8. Contact CTA


### Option C: Custom Link Images

Design custom thumbnails for your Featured links:
- When you add a link to Featured, LinkedIn shows the link preview image
- Create custom OG images for:
  - buildthatlast.substack.com (if you control the image)
  - innomizetech.com landing page


### Recommendation

**Start with Option A (PDF One-Pagers):**
- Faster to create
- Direct uploads to Featured
- Full control over design
- Can be updated easily

**Assets to create:**
1. `btl-featured-one-pager.pdf` — BTL summary
2. `innomize-featured-one-pager.pdf` — INNOMIZE capabilities

## Comparison to Previous Audits

| Section | Jan 7 Score | Jan 16 Score | Change | Reason |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Headline | 9/10 | 7/10 | -2 | New headline less impactful |
| About | 8/10 | 6/10 | -2 | Still no testimonials or BTL |
| Banner | 9/10 | 8/10 | -1 | Good, but no URL |
| Featured | 8/10 | 5/10 | -3 | Missing BTL, posts stay on-platform |
| Experience | 7/10 | 8/10 | +1 | BTL added |
| Recommendations | 9/10 | 9/10 | — | Still excellent |
| **Overall** | **8.5/10** | **8/10** | **-0.5** | About + Featured need work |


## Summary

Your profile has excellent raw materials (strong recommendations, clear positioning, good banner). The gaps are:

1. **About section** needs testimonials and BTL mention
2. **Featured section** needs restructuring around BTL + INNOMIZE (not posts)
3. **Headline** could be stronger with outcome/value focus

The recommended changes would bring your profile back to 9/10.
