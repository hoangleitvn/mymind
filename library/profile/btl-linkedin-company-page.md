## About

```
Builds That Last is an engineering leadership publication exploring what separates software that survives from software that collapses.

The industry is obsessed with speed. Ship fast. Demo fast. Build in a weekend. But there's a gap between what people post and what happens in actual production systems.

We call it the Iceberg Problem.

What you see is 20% above the water: the shiny demos, the fast shipping, the "everyone can build now" narrative.

What you don't see is the 80% below: the maintenance, the technical debt, engineers connecting systems that were never meant to work together, teams spending days just to understand what the previous developer was thinking.

That 80% is where real engineering happens. And it's where the real lessons are.

Builds That Last covers:
→ Foundation-first engineering practices
→ Technical leadership beyond the code
→ Sustainable software architecture
→ The hidden work that makes systems last
→ Lessons from 15+ years of building and maintaining production systems

This isn't about slowing down. It's about building the foundation that lets you move faster in the long run.

The teams that chase speed without foundation always hit a wall. The teams that invest in clarity first end up moving further.

Foundation first. Speed follows.

I'm not claiming to have all the answers. I'm building, learning, and sharing what I discover along the way.

Subscribe for weekly insights on building software—and teams—that last.
