## About Section (Full Text)

Most founders get stuck between vision and execution.

They have the idea. They have the market insight. What they don't have is a technical leader who acts like an owner, not a vendor billing hours.

I founded INNOMIZE to solve this. I work as your Fractional CTO or VP of Engineering. Not staff augmentation. Not outsourcing with hourly excuses. Accountability-driven development that gets you from zero to live users.

I also write Builds That Last, a publication exploring what separates software that survives from software that collapses. Foundation-first engineering, technical leadership beyond the code, and the hidden 80% that makes systems last.

What I bring:
→ 15+ years building engineering teams and products (startups and enterprise)
→ 50+ projects shipped: SaaS platforms, enterprise solutions, custom applications
→ Expertise in cloud architecture (AWS, Azure), system integration, and scaling from MVP to growth
→ A team of 40+ engineers in Vietnam delivering quality at 50-60% of US/EU rates

My approach is foundation-first. 90% of your team's energy goes to business logic, not scaffolding. We build for scale from day one, so you don't rebuild after product-market fit.

I work with:
• Technical founders stuck in planning who need to ship
• Non-technical co-founders who need a technical partner they can trust
• Early-stage companies (pre-product to Series A) that can't afford a full-time CTO

The goal is simple: speed to live users with quality that lasts.

If you're building something and need a technical owner (not just a team), let's talk.
