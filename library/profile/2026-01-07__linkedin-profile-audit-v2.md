## Section-by-Section Analysis

### 1. Headline (9/10)

**Current:**
> Fractional CTO | Builds that last | Ship fast, scale safely | Cloud, DevSecOps, AI

**What's Working:**
- Clear role identification ("Fractional CTO")
- Brand alignment ("Builds that last" = publication name)
- Philosophy captured ("Ship fast, scale safely")
- Technical keywords for search (Cloud, DevSecOps, AI)
- Clean 78-character structure

**Minor Gap:**
- No explicit audience mention (founders, startups)

**Recommendation:** Keep current. The headline is working well based on engagement metrics.


### 2. About Section (8/10) — IMPROVED

**Current (Verified via Chrome):**
Implemented as recommended in Nov 2025 document. Full PAS structure with:
- Strong hook: "Most founders get stuck between vision and execution"
- Clear positioning: Fractional CTO, accountability-driven development
- Specific numbers: 15+ years, 50+ projects, 40+ engineers, 50-60% savings
- Foundation-first philosophy explained
- Clear audience targeting (three bullet points)
- Direct CTA

**What's Working:**
- Hook is punchy and visible before "see more"
- Numbers provide credibility
- Clear differentiation from staff augmentation

**Gap:**
- No testimonials embedded in About (though recommendations section is strong)
- No off-platform link (newsletter or booking link)

**Recommendations:**
1. Add a condensed testimonial quote before CTA (optional given strong recommendations section)
2. Consider adding newsletter or Calendly link to CTA


### 3. Banner (9/10)

**Current (Verified):**
- "Everyone ships fast."
- "Few build to last." (red accent)
- "Building Teams That Build Things That Last"
- Subtext: "From zero to live users"

**What's Working:**
- Professional dark gradient design
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Brand color accent (red line)
- Message aligns with headline and About
- "Builds that last" brand consistent

**Minor Gap:**
- No URL or newsletter CTA on banner

**Recommendation:** Consider adding innomizetech.com or newsletter URL in next iteration.


### 4. Experience (7/10) — IMPROVED

**Status:** Most sections implemented with recommended copy structure.

**Verified Roles:**
| Role | Company | Duration | Status |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| Software Engineering Lead | Ingenie | Jun 2025 - Present (8 mos) | Updated |
| Director of Engineering | Biscayne Technologies | Nov 2023 - Present (2 yrs 3 mos) | Updated |
| CEO/CTO, Cloud Architect | INNOMIZE | Jul 2017 - Present (8 yrs 7 mos) | Updated |
| VP of Engineering | The Coral Edge | Jan 2020 - Present (6 yrs 1 mo) | Updated |
| Technical Manager | The Coral Edge | Jul 2017 - Dec 2019 | Basic |
| Technical Lead | TMA Solutions | Oct 2014 - Apr 2017 | Updated |
| Software Developer | TMA Solutions | Jan 2013 - Oct 2014 | Basic |

**What's Working:**
- First-person voice (no more "seasoned professional")
- Skills attached to each role
- Descriptions mention outcomes
- INNOMIZE role has clear founder narrative

**Remaining Gaps:**
- Specific metrics not visible in preview (e.g., "team of X engineers delivered Y")
- Some roles still show truncated descriptions

**Recommendations:**
1. Ensure each role has at least one quantified outcome visible in preview
2. Verify Ingenie role mentions team size or delivery milestone


### 5. Featured Section (8/10) — MAJOR IMPROVEMENT

**Current Status:** Implemented with 3+ items

| # | Type | Content | Engagement |
|---|------|---------|------------|
| 1 | Link | INNOMIZE website (innomizetech.com) | — |
| 2 | Post | "You got AI licenses 6 months ago. Quality is down. Trust is..." | 20 reactions, 4 comments |
| 3 | Post | "Coding is typing. Engineering is thinking..." | 52 reactions, 8 comments |

**What's Working:**
- INNOMIZE website link with clear description (off-platform CTA)
- High-performing posts featured (52 reactions on "Coding is typing" post)
- Mix of external link and content

**Gap:**
- No newsletter signup featured (if you have one)
- No Calendly booking link

**Recommendations:**
1. Add newsletter link if available
2. Consider swapping one post for a case study or "Why I stopped calling it outsourcing" post


### 6. Skills (8/10)

1. Technical Strategy
2. Startup Advisor
3. Fractional CTO
4. MVP Development
5. Engineering Management
6. Engineering Leadership
7. Software Integration

9. Project Management

**Total Skills:** 57

**What's Working:**
- "Fractional CTO" in top 5 (matches headline)
- "MVP Development" visible (target audience keyword)
- Mix of strategic and technical skills
- Skills attached to relevant experience

**Gap:**
- Endorsement counts not visible in audit
- "Engineering Leadership" at position 6 (could be higher)

**Recommendations:**
1. Request endorsements for top 5 skills from recent clients
2. Consider reordering: Engineering Leadership to top 3


### 7. Recommendations (9/10) — MAJOR IMPROVEMENT

- "High-quality results on time and within budget"

**What's Working:**
- All recommendations are recent (4 from Dec 2025)
- Mix of founders and technical leaders
- Multiple mention "Fractional CTO" or "embedded" model
- Long, detailed testimonials from Benjamin and Kirsti Elliott

**Recommendation:**
- Profile is strong in this area
- Consider requesting 1-2 more from non-technical founders for diversity


### 8. Activity (8/10) — NEW SECTION

**Recent Posts (Verified):**
| Time | Post | Engagement |
|------|------|------------|
| 5h ago | "Serverless is expensive at scale" is dead. AWS just killed that argument. | 6 reactions, 9 comments, 1 repost |
| 1d ago | The best engineers I know aren't the fastest coders. | 11 reactions, 13 comments, 1 repost |

**Analytics (7 Days):**
- Profile views: 609
- Post impressions: 3,579
- Search appearances: 42

**What's Working:**
- Active posting (multiple posts per week)
- Good engagement (9-13 comments per post)
- Content aligns with positioning (engineering leadership, technical decisions)
- Posts being reposted

**Recommendation:** Maintain current posting cadence. Content is working.


## Services Section (Bonus)

**Current Services Listed:**
- Custom Software Development
- Mobile Application Development
- Cloud Management
- Cloud Application Development
- SaaS Development
- IT Consulting
- Team Building
- Project Management

**Assessment:** Services align well with positioning. Covers key offerings.


## Certifications (Note)

**Current:**
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (Expired May 2022)
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (Expired Mar 2022)

**Recommendation:** Consider renewing AWS certifications if relevant to current work. Expired certs still show experience but active certs signal current expertise.


## Conversion Path Analysis

**Current Path (Improved):**
```
Content → Profile → Headline → About → Featured (INNOMIZE link) → Website
```

**Assessment:** The Featured section now provides an off-platform path. Conversion funnel is functional.

**Ideal Path:**
```
Content → Profile → Featured (Newsletter) → Email List → Website/Call
```

**Gap:** Newsletter signup missing from Featured. If you have a newsletter ("Builds That Last"?), add it.
