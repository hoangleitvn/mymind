### Recommended Structure

**Everyone ships fast. Few build to last.**

Engineering leadership for the long game. Foundation-first thinking, technical depth, and the 80% that determines whether systems survive or crumble.

**Why "Builds That Last"?**

Most engineering advice optimizes for speed. Ship fast. Move fast. Break things.

But speed is the visible 20%. The other 80%—architecture decisions, maintainability, team clarity—that's what determines whether your system is still running in two years or buried in technical debt.

This newsletter is for engineers and leaders who care about that 80%.

**What you'll find here:**
- Foundation-first engineering principles
- Technical leadership without the fluff
- Hard-earned lessons from real projects (not theory)

**What you won't find:**
- Quick hacks that fall apart under pressure
- Frameworks without tradeoffs
- Advice that sounds good but doesn't ship

## Principles Page (Draft)

**Purpose:** Codify core beliefs, link to posts that expand each

### Structure

```markdown
# Principles

These are the beliefs that guide everything I write.

1. **Foundation before speed.** Real speed comes from clarity, not from typing faster.

2. **The demo always works.** It's what comes after that separates software that lasts from software that collapses.

3. **Maintenance costs more than building.** Every shortcut in building becomes a tax on every future change.

4. **AI is a turbo, not a robot.** It speeds up what you already have. Good foundation? Faster good software. Bad foundation? Faster bad software.

5. **Knowing ≠ Applying.** The gap between knowing the right way and doing the right way is where most projects fail.

6. **Build for the people who come after.** The engineer who maintains your code in 10 years is your real customer.

[More principles added as I write about them]
