# LinkedIn Profile Audit: 2026-01-07

## Executive Summary

**Overall Score: 7.5/10**

Your profile has strong positioning with a clear Fractional CTO narrative. The December 2025 optimization established solid headline, About, and banner elements. The primary gaps are:
1. **Experience sections not updated** — Still carry the recommended copy, not verified as implemented
2. **Featured section empty** — Zero off-platform conversion assets
3. **Social proof missing** — No testimonials in About, no recommendations visible

| Section | Score | Change | Priority |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| Headline | 9/10 | — | Low |
| About | 7/10 | -1 | Medium |
| Banner | 9/10 | -1 | Low |
| Experience | 5/10 | -1 | **High** |
| Featured | 3/10 | -1 | **High** |
| Skills | 8/10 | -2 | Medium |
| Recommendations | 4/10 | New | **High** |


## Section-by-Section Analysis

### 1. Headline (9/10)

**Current:**
> Fractional CTO | Builds that last | Ship fast, scale safely | Cloud, DevSecOps, AI

**What's Working:**
- Clear role identification ("Fractional CTO")
- Brand alignment ("Builds that last" = publication name)
- Philosophy captured ("Ship fast, scale safely")
- Technical keywords for search (Cloud, DevSecOps, AI)
- Clean 78-character structure

**Gaps:**
- No explicit audience mention (founders, startups)
- "DevSecOps" may be unfamiliar to non-technical founders

**Recommendation:** Keep current. Consider A/B test adding "for Founders" if profile views from target audience drop.


### 2. About Section (7/10)

**Current (from Dec 2025):**
1,400 characters, PAS structure, foundation-first messaging

**What's Working:**
- Strong hook ("Most founders get stuck between vision and execution")
- Clear positioning (Fractional CTO, not staff augmentation)
- Specific numbers (15+ years, 50+ projects, 40+ engineers, 50-60% savings)
- Foundation-first philosophy explained
- Clear audience targeting (three bullet points)
- Direct CTA

**Gaps:**
- **No testimonials** — Framework recommends 3+ client testimonials for social proof
- **No link to off-platform asset** — Newsletter, website, or booking link missing
- Opening hook could be punchier (currently 8 words before "see more" click)

**Recommendations:**

1. **Add testimonials section** (Priority: High)
   Insert before CTA:
   ```
   What founders say:

   "Hoang got us from idea to live users in 12 weeks. He operated like a co-founder, not a contractor." — [Founder Name], [Company]

   "Finally found a technical partner who owns outcomes, not hours." — [Founder Name], [Company]
   ```

2. **Add off-platform CTA** (Priority: Medium)
   Change final CTA to:
   ```
   Building something? Book a 30-min strategy call: [calendly.com/hoangle]
   Or subscribe to my newsletter: [substack link]
   ```


### 3. Banner (9/10)

**Current:** linkedin-banner-v22-larger-text-4x.png

**What's Working:**
- Professional dark gradient design
- Clear typography (54px/24px/18px)
- Brand color accent (red line)
- Center-aligned, clean layout

**Gaps:**
- **No CTA or URL** — Banner should drive off-platform (newsletter URL, website)
- Missing social proof number on banner (e.g., "Trusted by 50+ founders")

**Recommendation:** Update banner to include:
- Newsletter name + subscriber count (if >500)
- Or website URL (innomizetech.com)


### 4. Experience (5/10) — HIGH PRIORITY

**Status:** Recommended copy exists in Dec 2025 document but implementation not verified.

**Issues Found (if not implemented):**
- Ingenie: Third-person, buzzwords, no outcomes
- The Coral Edge: Duty-focused, no metrics, too long
- Biscayne: Mixed tenses, company-focused intro
- TMA: Minimal detail, unexplained "Cloud Club"

**What's Missing Across All Roles:**
- **Quantified outcomes** — No revenue impact, no team size growth, no delivery metrics
- **Keyword optimization** — Missing "Fractional CTO", "embedded", "MVP"
- **Narrative arc** — Roles don't tell a coherent growth story

**Action Required:**

1. **Verify implementation** — Check if Dec 2025 recommended copy was actually applied
2. **Add metrics to each role:**

| Role | Metric to Add |
|------|---------------|
| Ingenie | "Leading team of X engineers" or "Delivered MVP in X weeks" |
| INNOMIZE | Already strong — verify "50+ products", "40+ engineers" visible |
| Coral Edge | Add client count or project value |
| Biscayne | Add "X solutions delivered" or "X clients served" |
| TMA | Add "team of X" or "X integrations delivered" |


### 5. Featured Section (3/10) — HIGH PRIORITY

**Current Status:** No featured items implemented

**Impact:** Missing the biggest conversion opportunity. Featured is your "digital storefront" — the place to send people OFF LinkedIn.

**Framework Violation:**
> "Featured should drive people OFF LinkedIn to where YOU control the narrative. Link to newsletter, website, products — NOT your best posts."

**Recommended Featured Items (in priority order):**

| # | Item | Type | Why |
|---|------|------|-----|
| 1 | Newsletter signup | External link | Email capture, build owned audience |
| 2 | INNOMIZE website | External link | Company credibility, service info |
| 3 | Calendly booking | External link | Direct conversion to calls |

**Implementation:**
- Create simple Featured card for newsletter (Builds That Last)
- Add innomizetech.com with clear description
- Skip featuring LinkedIn posts (keeps people on platform)


### 6. Skills (8/10)

**Current Recommended Order:**
1. Fractional CTO
2. Engineering Leadership
3. MVP Development
4. Technical Strategy
5. Startup Advisory

**What's Working:**
- "Fractional CTO" as top skill matches headline
- Skills align with positioning
- Mix of technical and advisory skills

**Gaps:**
- **Endorsement count unknown** — Target 99+ for credibility signal
- Verify skills were actually reordered on LinkedIn

**Recommendations:**
1. Check current endorsement counts
2. Request endorsements from recent clients/collaborators
3. Add "AI/ML Development" if doing AI projects (matches headline "AI")


### 7. Recommendations (4/10) — NEW PRIORITY

**Issue:** Not assessed in previous audits but critical for social proof.

**Framework Guidance:**
> "Display recent, heartfelt testimonials. Target 99+ endorsements for credibility signal."

**Current Status:** Unknown number of recommendations

**Action Required:**
1. Count current recommendations
2. Request recommendations from:
   - 2-3 founders you've worked with
   - 1-2 CTOs/technical leaders (peer credibility)
   - 1 team member (leadership style validation)

**Template for Requesting:**
```
Hi [Name],

Would you be open to writing a brief LinkedIn recommendation about our work together on [project]?

Specifically, I'd appreciate if you could mention:
- The problem you were facing when we started
- How we worked together (embedded ownership approach)
- The outcome you achieved

Happy to reciprocate if helpful.
```

## Conversion Path Audit

**Current Path:**
```
Content → Profile → Headline → About → [Dead End]
```

**Issue:** No clear next step after reading About. Visitor has no obvious action.

**Desired Path:**
```
Content → Profile → Headline → About → Featured → Newsletter/Call Booking → Email List/Meeting
```

**Fixes Required:**
1. Featured section with off-platform links
2. About section CTA with specific link
3. Banner with URL/newsletter mention


## Comparison to Dec 2025 Audit

| Metric | Dec 2025 | Jan 2026 | Change |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Overall Score | 8/10 | 7.5/10 | -0.5 |
| Headline | 10/10 | 9/10 | -1 |
| About | 8/10 | 7/10 | -1 |
| Experience | 6/10 | 5/10 | -1 |
| Featured | 4/10 | 3/10 | -1 |

**Why the decrease?**
- Scored against stricter framework (added testimonial requirement)
- Featured section remains unimplemented
- No verification that Dec 2025 changes were applied
- Added Recommendations as new audit dimension


## Quick Wins (15 Minutes Each)

1. **Add newsletter to Featured** — Single link, no description needed
2. **Add INNOMIZE website to Featured** — Direct external link
3. **Reorder skills** — Move Fractional CTO to position #1
4. **Send 3 recommendation requests** — Use template above


## Next Steps

1. Verify which Dec 2025 actions were actually implemented on LinkedIn
2. Implement the 4 Quick Wins above
3. Schedule recommendation requests (aim for 3 new recommendations this month)
4. Create/gather 2-3 testimonials for About section
5. Next audit: April 2026 or after significant changes
