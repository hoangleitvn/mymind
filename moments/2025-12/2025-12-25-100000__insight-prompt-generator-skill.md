# Insight: Prompt Generator Skill

## The Moment

While discussing building a Level 4 prompt for a diagram generation skill, realized:

> "Why don't we build a skill to write this kind of prompt - like a prompt generator for a specific level?"

## The Meta-Insight

Instead of writing individual Level 4/5 prompts for each use case, build a **skill that generates Level 4/5 prompts** for ANY use case.

## Why This Matters

- **Codifies the True Context framework** into a reusable tool
- **Makes Level 4/5 prompting accessible** to anyone
- **Demonstrates True Context in action** - using Level 5 to build the generator
- **Scales the framework** - one skill, infinite prompts

## The Two Options

| Option | What we build | Output |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| A | Specific skill (e.g., diagrams) | Solves one problem |
| B | Prompt generator skill | Solves the meta-problem |

Option B is a **prompt factory**.

## How It Would Work

1. User describes task/challenge
2. User selects target level (3, 4, or 5)
3. Skill asks clarifying questions
4. Skill outputs structured prompt

## Connection to Mizemind

This skill would be a core part of True Context Engine:
- Helps users write better prompts
- Teaches the framework through usage
- Generates prompts that leverage workspace context

## Next Step

Build a Level 5 prompt to create the prompt generator skill itself.
