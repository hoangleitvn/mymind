# Serverless Deep Dive Series

## Raw Capture

10+ years working with serverless. Built a product that's still running. Seeing renewed discussion in the community. Time to share accumulated perspective and connect it to where the industry is heading.

## Context

- **Experience**: 10+ years hands-on serverless development
- **Proof**: Production product still running on serverless architecture
- **Trigger**: Recent AWS research + community posts about "post-serverless" era
- **Connection**: Core tech focus for Mizestack

## Key Influencers to Reference

| Creator | Platform | Focus |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Jeremy Daly | [jeremydaly.com](https://jeremydaly.com) | Serverless architecture, AWS |
| Jeremy Daly | [Off by None](https://offbynone.io/) | Weekly serverless newsletter |
| Yan Cui | [The Burning Monk](https://theburningmonk.com) | Serverless patterns, AWS |

## Jeremy Daly's "Post-Serverless World" Key Points

From [jeremydaly.com/post-serverless-world](https://jeremydaly.com/post-serverless-world/):

**Core thesis**: We're entering a phase where serverless becomes invisible—not because it "won," but because it finally delivers on its promise: stop thinking about infrastructure that doesn't differentiate your product.

**Recent improvements**:
- Lambda Managed Instances (better execution at scale)
- Durable Functions (reduced orchestration complexity)
- Aurora DSQL (faster database provisioning)

**Future vision**: "Autonomous cloud" where infrastructure becomes a decision engine—systems infer intent, observe outcomes, adapt continuously. Human oversight shifts to intent and constraints, not execution details.

## Series Concept

**Potential topics:**

1. **What Serverless Actually Means** (beyond Lambda)
   - The real promise vs. marketing hype
   - Operational model, not just compute model

2. **Why Serverless as Default Choice**
   - Decision factors from 10+ years experience
   - When NOT to use serverless
   - Total cost beyond compute pricing

3. **Serverless + Containers: Not Either/Or**
   - Containerization patterns that complement serverless
   - ECS Fargate, Lambda container images
   - The convergence happening now

4. **The Next 5-10 Years**
   - Autonomous infrastructure trends
   - AI workloads changing the game
   - What developers will stop thinking about

5. **Lessons from a Decade of Production Serverless**
   - What we got right
   - What we'd do differently
   - Patterns that survived

## Content Potential

- **Platform**: LinkedIn (posts) + Blog (articles)
- **Format**: Series (5-7 pieces)
- **Angle**: Practitioner perspective, not theory. 10+ years of "here's what actually happens"
- **Differentiator**: Long-term production experience, not just tutorials

## Why This Matters

- Positions you as experienced practitioner in cloud architecture
- Connects to Mizestack tech focus
- Contributes to industry conversation at inflection point
- Builds on AWS research momentum
