# Team Conversation: No Planning, Just Doing. And Premature Optimization.

## Raw Capture

Talking with team yesterday about their tasks. I realized they're not planning. They're just doing continuously. They see something new, pick it up, do it. This doesn't work.

### The Questions I Asked

**Q1: "What are you doing and why?"**
→ Silence. Cannot explain clearly.

**Q2: "Do you have other things to do?"**
→ Cannot answer. Seems like he only has one thing to do at a time.

**My message:** If you only have one thing to do, stop doing it and start planning, prioritizing.

**Q3: "If you're on a mountain and heavy rain starts, do you go up or down?"**
→ They both answered: "Go down."
→ But the correct answer is: Go UP. (Higher ground = safer from flash floods)

This question is from an author I recently listened to. Maybe related to "reverse thinking" or contrarian thinking. Need to find the source.

### Premature Optimization Example

My DevOps team is building an error tracking plugin in Grafana. He's watching Sentry, learning the beautiful UI, and now wants to polish his plugin with better UI.

But what he should be doing next: build the alert system and core functions that make the plugin valuable.

Without beautiful UI but WITH alerts = useful tool
With beautiful UI but WITHOUT alerts = useless decoration

This is textbook premature optimization.

## Key Insights

### 1. Reactive Work vs. Planned Work

**Symptom:** Cannot explain what you're doing or why
**Root cause:** No plan, just reacting to whatever appears next
**Solution:** Stop. Plan. Prioritize. Then execute.

If you only have one thing on your list, you haven't planned. You're just doing what's in front of you.

### 2. The Mountain Rain Question (Reverse Thinking)

Intuitive answer: Go down (get off the mountain)
Correct answer: Go up (avoid flash floods in valleys)

This tests whether people think through consequences or follow intuition blindly.

**Application to work:**
- Intuitive: Fix the bug in front of you
- Reverse thinking: Is this bug the most important thing? What happens if I fix something else first?

### 3. Premature Optimization

**Pattern observed:**
- See beautiful thing (Sentry UI)
- Want to replicate beautiful thing
- Forget the core value (alerts, error tracking)

**The priority should be:**
1. Core function that delivers value (alerts)
2. Supporting functions (error grouping, search)
3. Polish and UI (only after core works)

**Rule:** Make it work → Make it right → Make it beautiful

Never skip steps 1 and 2 to get to step 3.

## Coaching Takeaways

### Questions to Ask Team Members

1. **"What are you working on and why?"**
   - If they can't answer clearly, they haven't planned

2. **"What else is on your list?"**
   - If nothing, they're not planning, just reacting

3. **"What's the most valuable thing you could ship this week?"**
   - Forces prioritization thinking

4. **"If you could only ship one thing, what would it be?"**
   - Identifies the core value

### Signs of No Planning

- Can't explain current work
- Only one task visible
- Picks up new work as it appears
- No sense of priority or sequence
- Surprised by deadlines

### Signs of Premature Optimization

- Polishing before core function works
- Copying aesthetics before substance
- "Making it beautiful" before "making it useful"
- Time spent on 20% that doesn't matter

## Content Potential

**High potential for multiple pieces:**

### Post 1: The Planning Test
"If you can only name one thing you're working on, you haven't planned."

### Post 2: The Mountain Question
"Heavy rain on a mountain. Do you go up or down? Most people get this wrong."
(Need to find original source/author)

### Post 3: Premature Optimization
"My DevOps engineer was building beautiful UI for a tool that couldn't alert. Make it work before you make it beautiful."

### Post 4: Coaching Questions
"3 questions I ask my team to check if they're planning or just reacting"

## Research Needed

- [ ] Find the author/source of the "mountain rain" question
- [ ] May be related to: reverse thinking, contrarian thinking, second-order thinking
- [ ] Could be from: Charlie Munger? Shane Parrish? Another thinker?

## Follow-up

- [ ] Share planning framework with team
- [ ] Create simple planning template they can use
- [ ] Follow up on DevOps plugin priorities
- [ ] Develop one of these into a post
