## The Pattern

**Fixing symptoms repeatedly before addressing the system.**

This shows up everywhere:
- Asking AI to manually fix the same issue multiple times instead of automating or preventing
- Engineering teams applying the same hotfix instead of addressing root cause
- Choosing familiar friction over unfamiliar discipline

## The Reframe

First time is learning. Second time with the same justification? That's a decision.

When you have the data and still choose the manual fix, it's not a mistake anymore. It's comfort disguised as urgency.

## The Principle

Work smarter, not harder.

- Automate what repeats
- Prevent what you can predict
- Build systems, not just solutions

## Connection

Related to Lindsay Linhart's post: "Is this still a mistake, or a decision I'm making?"

Applied to engineering: Is this still an emergency, or a pattern I'm choosing to maintain?
