# Mize Studio Big Picture: Community, Workshop, Seminar, Events

## Raw Capture

I have a big picture for Mize Studio:
- Community
- Workshop
- Seminar
- Events

## Context

- Source: Strategic vision for Mize Studio
- Stage: Early vision / direction setting
- Connection: Extends beyond product development into community building

## Key Elements

| Pillar | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Community** | Build tribe of founders, engineers, builders |
| **Workshop** | Hands-on learning, skill transfer |
| **Seminar** | Knowledge sharing, thought leadership |
| **Events** | Connection, networking, visibility |

## The Vision

Mize Studio evolves from a product arm into a platform for:
1. **Community** - Ongoing relationships with founders and tech leaders
2. **Workshop** - Practical skill building (coding, product, leadership)
3. **Seminar** - Deeper dives into topics (architecture, scaling, AI)
4. **Events** - In-person or virtual gatherings for networking

## Content Potential

- **Not ready for public post yet** - This is internal vision
- Could become: "Why we're building more than software" narrative
- Could document the journey as each pillar launches

## Questions to Explore

- What's the order of priority? (Community first? Events first?)
- What's the MVP for each pillar?
- How do these connect to INNOMIZE / embedded CTO model?
- Revenue model: Free community + paid workshops? All free for brand?
- Target audience: Same as INNOMIZE clients or broader?

## Follow-up

- Flesh out each pillar with specifics
- Define success metrics for each
- Create roadmap / sequence
- Potential content series: "Building Mize Studio in public"
