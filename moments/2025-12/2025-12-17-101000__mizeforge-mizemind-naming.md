# Product Naming Decision: Mizemind vs Mizemind

## The Question
Deciding between using **Mizemind** or **Mizemind** as the core platform name.

## Context
- **Mizemind** = the brain, the content creation engine
- **Mizeflow** = visualization layer, spatial canvas for content constellation

## Considerations
- Mizemind implies crafting, building, forging ideas into content
- Mizemind suggests thinking, cognition, the mental aspects of content creation
- The "Mize" prefix creates a product family: Mizeflow, Mizestack

## Architecture View
```
Mizemind (?)          - Strategic thinking layer
    └── Mizemind     - Content creation brain
        └── Mizeflow  - Visual content pipeline
```

## Open Questions
- Does "forge" convey the crafting aspect better?
- Does "mind" suggest AI/intelligence partnership better?
- Could both coexist with different roles?
