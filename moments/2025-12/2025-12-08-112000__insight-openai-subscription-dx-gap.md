# OpenAI Subscription Red Flag: DX Gap Driving Tool Choice

## Raw Capture

Subscribed to OpenAI for $22/month but keep moving away from it. Sometimes it's the responses, but the real issue: I figured out what works best for me.

Claude Code wins because of DX:
- Flexible, can build my own workflow and system
- Store everything on my machine (plain markdown files)
- I see what it is, easy to ask CC to find relevant stuff when I can't remember
- With ChatGPT I have to dig through past history. Bad DX.

People make ChatGPT work with MCP + Notion, but I'm not comfortable with Notion. I'd rather store markdown locally.

## Context

- Paying $22/month for OpenAI subscription
- Increasingly not using it
- Claude Code became primary tool
- Local-first workflow preference

## Key Takeaways

1. **DX trumps capability** - Even if ChatGPT has features, the friction of finding past context kills the workflow
2. **Local-first preference** - Markdown on disk > cloud-based history search
3. **Workflow ownership** - Being able to build your own system matters more than out-of-box features
4. **The subscription red flag** - Paying for something you're not using is a signal worth examining

## Content Potential

**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Format:** Personal experience post
**Angle:** "Why I'm reconsidering my OpenAI subscription" or "The DX gap nobody talks about"

**Possible hooks:**
- "I pay $22/month for a tool I barely use anymore."
- "ChatGPT vs Claude Code isn't about capability. It's about DX."
- "The best AI tool is the one that fits your workflow, not the one with more features."

**Key points to develop:**
- Subscription fatigue + tool switching
- Why DX matters more than features
- Local-first vs cloud-first workflows
- Building your own system vs adapting to someone else's

**Related themes:**
- AI tool selection (connects to Aditya's post about choosing AI models)
- Build vs buy philosophy
- Developer experience as competitive advantage

## Follow-up

- Track: When do I actually use ChatGPT vs Claude Code?
- Research: Are others experiencing similar subscription fatigue?
- Consider: Is this a post or part of a larger "AI tools I actually use" series?
