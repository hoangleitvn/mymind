# Gemini Adoption Plan for Google Workspace Teams

## Raw Capture

Need a plan for how to use Gemini across the team since we're already in the Google Workspace ecosystem. Want to leverage the full stack: AI Studio for internal apps, Gemini for email, writing docs, etc.

## Use Case Ideas

**Email & Communication:**
- Gemini in Gmail for drafting, summarizing, replying
- Meeting summaries in Google Meet
- Smart compose and context-aware suggestions

**Documentation:**
- Gemini in Google Docs for writing, editing, formatting
- Help me write / refine features
- Document summarization and extraction

**Internal Apps (AI Studio):**
- Build custom AI assistants for team workflows
- Create tools for specific use cases (code review helper, onboarding bot, etc.)
- Prototype AI features before production implementation

**Data & Analysis:**
- Gemini in Google Sheets for analysis and formulas
- Data summarization and insights
- Report generation

**Development:**
- Gemini Code Assist for coding
- Integration with existing Google Cloud infrastructure

## Planning Questions

## Potential Content

Could become:
