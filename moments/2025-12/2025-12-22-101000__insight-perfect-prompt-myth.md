# The Perfect Prompt Myth

## Raw Capture

People used to think writing a perfect prompt will bring good results, but they are wrong. Here is why.

Firstly, they don't understand the model they are using whether this is general LLM or a reasoning model.

Second, they are not defining their goals whether this is a creative task or automating their workflow.

- Creative work allows innovation with less alignment, fewer rules.
- Workflow work requires consistency, following domain experts, more rules.

## Key Insight

**The prompt is not the problem. The context is.**

Two dimensions people miss:

| Dimension | Question to Ask |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Model Type** | Am I using a general LLM or a reasoning model? |
| **Task Type** | Am I doing creative work or workflow automation? |

## The 2x2 Framework

|  | General LLM | Reasoning Model |
|--|-------------|-----------------|
| **Creative** | Open prompts, explore possibilities | Structured exploration, chain of thought |
| **Workflow** | Templates, examples, constraints | Rules, validation, domain expertise |

## Why This Matters

- "Prompt engineering" courses teach tactics without strategy
- People optimize prompts when they should be choosing models
- Creative tasks need freedom; workflow tasks need guardrails
- One-size-fits-all prompting fails both use cases

## Content Potential

**Format options:**
- LinkedIn post: Contrarian take on "perfect prompt" myth
- Thread: 2x2 framework breakdown
- Article: Deep dive into creative vs. workflow AI usage

**Hook ideas:**
- "Your prompts aren't the problem. Your context is."
- "If you're perfecting prompts, switch to understanding models. Context matters more than wording."
- "The prompt engineering industry is lying to you."

**Structure:**
1. Hook: Perfect prompt myth
2. Problem: Two things people miss (model type, task type)
3. Framework: 2x2 matrix
4. Insight: Match approach to context
5. Close: Context > prompt
