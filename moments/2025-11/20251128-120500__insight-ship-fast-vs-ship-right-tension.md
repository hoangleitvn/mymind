# Ship Fast vs Ship Right — The Founder Tension

## Raw Capture

It seems I am building more for Mizemind and I haven't released yet. This might not align with the "ship faster" from my identity. I think ship faster is good but ship bad also not good. How do we balance, what should I do.

## Context

- Building Mizemind (content creation framework)
- Haven't released yet — still building
- Feeling tension between stated principle ("ship early") and current behavior
- Aware that shipping bad work creates different problems

## The Tension

Two principles in conflict:

| Principle | From Identity | Risk if Ignored |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Ship early, simplify and ship smaller" | Core value | Never launching, perfectionism trap |
| "Build things that last, don't make it a future person's problem" | Core value | Technical debt, rework, bad reputation |

Both are true. The question is: **which applies now?**

## Key Insight

"Ship fast" doesn't mean "ship anything."

It means: **Ship the smallest thing that proves or disproves your assumption.**

The question isn't "Is Mizemind perfect?"
The question is: "What's the smallest version that teaches me something?"

## Questions to Explore

- What assumption am I trying to validate with Mizemind?
- What's the 20% that delivers 80% of the value?
- Am I building for users or building for myself?
- What's the cost of NOT shipping now?
- What would "ugly but working" look like for Mizemind?
- Am I avoiding release because it's not ready, or because I'm scared of feedback?

## Framework: When to Ship vs When to Build

**Ship now if:**
- You're building features no one asked for
- You're polishing instead of validating
- You've been "almost done" for weeks
- You can't articulate what's blocking release

**Build more if:**
- Core functionality is broken
- Users will hit dead ends immediately
- The foundation will require full rewrite
- You're genuinely learning something new each iteration

## Potential Resolution

1. **Define MVP scope** — What's the minimum that creates value?
2. **Set a ship date** — Even internal deadline creates pressure
3. **Find one user** — Ship to one person, get feedback
4. **Separate "foundation" from "features"** — Foundation can be solid; features can be minimal

## Content Potential

- **Platform:** LinkedIn
- **Format:** Founder vulnerability / principle tension post
- **Angles:**
  - "Ship fast is a trap without this caveat"
  - "I preach ship early. Here's why I haven't shipped."
  - "The difference between shipping fast and shipping garbage"
- **Hook type:** Contrarian self-reflection
- **Related to:** "ugly but working > perfect but invisible" quote

## Follow-up

- [ ] Define: What is Mizemind MVP?
- [ ] List: What's in scope vs out of scope for v1?
- [ ] Decide: Ship date or ship trigger?
- [ ] Identify: Who is the first user?
