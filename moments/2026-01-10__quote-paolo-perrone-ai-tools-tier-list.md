# AI tools tier list (Paolo Perrone)

## Raw capture

The only AI tools you need in 2026.

Tested everything. Deleted most. Kept these.

**S Tier — Pick one, master it:**
→ ChatGPT — deep research + voice mode
→ Claude — writing + coding
→ Gemini — image/video gen + learning

**A Tier — Most people should use:**
→ NotebookLM — chat with your docs, zero hallucination
→ Perplexity — search without SEO garbage
→ Comet — AI browser that controls pages for you
→ Deep Research — 30-min reports, fully cited

**B Tier — Specific use cases:**

Writing & Presentations:
→ Claude — upload samples, matches your voice
→ Gamma — full deck from one prompt

Image Generation:
→ Nano Banana — best aesthetics
→ ChatGPT — best prompt understanding
→ Reve — character consistency

Audio:
→ ElevenLabs — voice cloning, text-to-speech
→ Suno — full songs from prompts

Video:
→ Sora 2 — realistic video gen
→ Veo 3 — Google's alternative
→ HeyGen — AI avatars + 175 languages

Automation:
→ n8n — open source, self-hostable
→ Zapier/Make — faster setup, less control

Visuals:
→ Napkin AI — text to diagrams

Coding:
→ Cursor — AI-assisted coding

The S tier does 80% of the work.
Everything else is situational.
