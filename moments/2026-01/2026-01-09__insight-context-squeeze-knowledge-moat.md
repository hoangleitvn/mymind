# The Context Squeeze: Where LLM Constraints Meet Documentation Collapse

## Raw Capture

Connection between two LinkedIn threads:

**Vatche thread (LLM constraints):**
- "Wild frontier" - throttling, rate limits, token wars
- Can't just throw more agents at problems
- "Fewer agents, better context > more agents, token wars"

**Nico thread (documentation collapse):**
- Stack Overflow dying, public knowledge drying up
- Solutions captured privately by AI companies
- The knowledge base AI draws from is shrinking

## The Insight

As public knowledge declines, the quality of YOUR context becomes the differentiator.

You can't compensate with volume (more agents) because:
1. Rate limits stop you
2. The public knowledge pool is shrinking anyway

Both constraints point the same direction: **quality of context > quantity of calls**

## Content Angles

### Angle 1: Context is the New Moat

The wild frontier has two constraints closing in:
1. Token limits on how much you can ask
2. Knowledge limits on what's available to ask about

The teams that win aren't running more agents. They're building better private context - documentation, patterns, playbooks that AI companies don't have.

### Angle 2: The Context Squeeze

Public knowledge is drying up (Stack Overflow collapse).
LLM access is throttled (rate limits, token wars).

Both constraints point the same direction: quality of context > quantity of calls.

The engineers who build their own knowledge base will outpace those relying on public pools.

### Angle 3: Build Your Own Knowledge Graph

Everyone's debugging with AI. Few are capturing what they learn.

The documentation collapse means: the next generation of models has less to train on. Your private context becomes more valuable, not less.

Fewer agents, better context isn't just efficiency. It's survival.

## Why This Matters

- Connects practical constraint (throttling) to systemic shift (knowledge collapse)
- Actionable: build your own context, don't rely on public pools
- Contrarian: most people think "more AI = better" but constraints say otherwise
- Ties to my themes: foundation-first, documentation, practical engineering

## Potential Formats

- LinkedIn post: "The Context Squeeze" - short, punchy
- Substack article: deeper exploration of both constraints converging
- Series: Part of "documentation collapse" follow-up content
