# Idea: Expand 5 Skills Article with Mental Models + Claude Code

## Context

Article 3 in AI Adoption series needs expansion beyond just listing the 5 skills.

## Key Additions

### 1. Contrast with Prompt Library Approach

**The "1000 prompts" problem:**
- Prompt libraries give you templates
- But 1000 prompts don't teach you when to use which
- Copy-paste prompting doesn't transfer across contexts
- Skills > prompts (prompts are outputs of skills)

**Research needed:**
- Find examples of popular prompt libraries
- Show limitations (context-dependent, outdated quickly)
- Mental models are transferable, prompts are not

### 2. Mental Models Foundation

**What is a mental model:**
- Simplified representation of how something works
- Helps predict outcomes and make decisions
- Transferable across contexts

**Mental models for AI:**
- AI as pattern matcher (not thinker)
- AI as confident but fallible assistant
- AI as first-draft generator
- AI as context-dependent (garbage in, garbage out)

**How mental models apply to prompting:**
- Right mental model → right approach
- Wrong mental model → wrong expectations → frustration
- Example: Treating AI as search engine vs. treating AI as junior colleague

### 3. Practical Application with Claude Code

**Show real workflow:**
- How to apply 5 skills in Claude Code context
- Problem framing: Clear task description
- Decomposition: TodoWrite, step-by-step
- Evaluation: Define "done" before starting
- Correction: Edit tool vs. regenerate
- Systems thinking: CLAUDE.md, skills, templates

**Demo:**
- Real example from our workflow
- Before/after comparison

### 4. Future: Skills Plugin

**Plugin concept:**
- Skills as executable guidance
- Not prompt templates, but thinking frameworks
- Load skill → get mental model + workflow + validation
- Build library of transferable skills

## Article Structure (Revised)

1. **Opening:** Same tool, different results
2. **The prompt library trap:** Why 1000 prompts don't work
3. **Mental models:** What they are, why they matter
4. **The 5 skills:** (current content, refined)
5. **Practical application:** Claude Code workflow demo
6. **What's next:** Building skills systematically

## Action Items

- [ ] Research prompt library examples for contrast
- [ ] Define 3-5 mental models for AI usage
- [ ] Create Claude Code workflow example
- [ ] Outline plugin concept for future article
