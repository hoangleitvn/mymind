# AI Knowledge Capture: The Collective Action Problem

## Raw Capture

From LinkedIn thread with Nico Valencia about Stack Overflow dying and AI companies capturing developer knowledge.

**The pattern:**
- Stack Overflow was public knowledge
- Now debugging happens privately with AI
- Solutions go to AI company databases, not public forums
- AI companies have no incentive to fix this - harder debugging = more AI usage = more data capture = more money

**The game theory framing (Nico's addition):**
- Markets are game theory
- No incentive = no action
- These market realities are often unintentional but cause long-term industry shifts

**My insight:**
- Individually rational, collectively harmful
- Every private debugging session is a data contribution
- Developers are playing the game without realizing it
- Collective action problem: use AI to debug faster (rational) → public knowledge dries up (harmful)

## The Uncomfortable Question

Will the pain get bad enough to shift behavior? Or does this just become the new normal?

## Content Angles

**Substack Note:**
"The uncomfortable thing about working with AI: every private debugging session feeds a loop you can't see. Individually rational. Collectively harmful. Game theory playing out in real time."

**LinkedIn Post:**
- Expand on documentation collapse post
- Game theory framing
- Collective action problem in AI adoption
