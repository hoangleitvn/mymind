# Tech Lead Workshop: IC to Leadership Transition

## Raw Capture

Sparked by Daniil Shykhov's post about giving up coding for 6 months and Anton Martyniuk's comment about the "unsexy work" of being a tech lead.

**Anton's realistic breakdown of tech lead work:**

The unsexy work:
- Meetings
- Talking with stakeholders
- Planning sprints
- Emails and text messages all day long
- That urgent issue in production
- Reports
- Planning
- Making interviews
- 1 vs 1s, helping my team
- Code Reviews

And the rest of the time?
- Designing systems
- Writing some code

## The Insight

Most new tech leads aren't prepared for this reality. They expect to keep coding with some management on the side. The reality is inverted.

**Our coaching framework:**
- As an IC, your value = code you ship
- As a leader, your value = code your team ships

**The failure modes:**
1. Leaders who get promoted but keep coding (become bottleneck)
2. Leaders who step back completely (team drifts)

**The balance:**
- Still write, but different things: architecture, standards, code reviews
- Focus on alignment, support, autonomy - not abandonment

## Workshop Outline Ideas

### Module 1: The Identity Shift
- IC success ≠ leadership success
- The math: 1x solo vs 5x enabling
- Why letting go feels like losing
- Signs you haven't made the shift (bottleneck indicators)

### Module 2: The Unsexy Work (Anton's list)
- What tech lead work actually looks like
- Time allocation reality check
- Making peace with meetings and docs
- Finding flow in different work

### Module 3: What Leaders Write Instead
- Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Standards and best practices
- Code reviews that teach
- Documentation that scales

### Module 4: The Two Failure Modes
- The coding bottleneck (still IC in disguise)
- The absent leader (delegation without support)
- Finding the balance: autonomy with alignment

### Module 5: Measuring Your Impact
- From "I shipped" to "they shipped"
- Longer feedback loops
- Invisible work that matters
- Leading indicators vs lagging indicators

## Existing Content to Leverage

**Published LinkedIn posts:**
- "The Best IC Might Become Your Worst Manager" (2025-12-04)
- "Team leadership isn't about being the best IC" (2025-11-24)

**Key frameworks already developed:**
- IC vs Leader value equation
- Signs you haven't/have made the shift
- The bottleneck indicators

## Potential Formats

1. **Internal INNOMIZE workshop** - Train our own tech leads first
2. **External offering** - Part of embedded CTO services
3. **LinkedIn series** - Break into 5 posts matching modules
4. **Substack article** - Deep dive on IC-to-leader transition

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review existing AI Adoption Workshop structure for format inspiration
- [ ] Draft Module 1 outline in detail
- [ ] Test with current INNOMIZE tech leads
- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate

## Why This Matters

- Direct application to INNOMIZE team development
- Differentiator for embedded CTO offering
- Content engine: workshop → posts → articles
- Addresses real pain point for growing engineering teams
