# AI tool selection is unconscious

## Raw capture

Asked one of our engineers why they often use ChatGPT web instead of using Codex or Copilot within their IDE (they have it open anyway). Cannot explain WHY. They just use it without asking why and which tool they should use.

## Extracted

- **Observation:** Engineers default to ChatGPT web even with IDE tools available and open
- **Key detail:** They can't articulate why they choose one over the other
- **Pattern:** Tool selection is habitual, not intentional

## Why this matters

Reveals gap between tool availability and deliberate tool selection. Teams adopt AI tools but don't develop judgment about when to use which tool. Muscle memory wins over optimization.

## Content angles

- LinkedIn: Most teams have 3+ AI coding tools. Few know when to use which.
- Contrarian: Tool proliferation without selection criteria = wasted licenses
- Practical: Framework for "which AI tool for which task"
