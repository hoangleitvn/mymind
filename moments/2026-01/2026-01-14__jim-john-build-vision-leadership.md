# Build Vision - Leadership Insight

## The Insight

From Jim John on leadership: **Build Vision** - this brings actionable results and makes us grow.

## My Reflection

I might not be good enough yet, but this is what I believe: **strong foundation brings values**.

This connects to BTL's core philosophy - the 80% below the surface matters more than the 20% everyone sees.

## The Deeper Truth

> People follow what you do, not what you say.

This is why BTL isn't just a publication - it's a practice. I'm not claiming to have answers. I'm building, learning, and sharing the journey.

Vision without action is just talk. The teams and leaders I respect most are the ones who build while they teach.

## Connection to BTL

This reinforces the foundation-first philosophy:
- Vision is the tip of the iceberg (20%)
- The building, learning, failing, iterating is the foundation (80%)
- People follow the foundation, not the vision statement
